              "{'title': 'New study by National Geographic Explorers provides first-ever comprehensive assessment of ecosystem services of Brazil’s coastal mangrove forests',\n",
              " 'text': 'Em português\\n\\nWashington, D.C. (Feb. 7) — Released today, a new study provides the first-ever empirical assessment of ecosystem services — the benefits we receive from nature — of Brazilian mangroves. The study, titled “Flow of mangrove ecosystem services to coastal communities in the Brazilian Amazon” published by Frontiers in Environmental Science and co-authored by National Geographic Explorers Margaret Awuor Owuor and Angelo Bernardino, gives evidence of the critical environmental, social, economic, and cultural value mangroves hold for coastal communities.\\n\\nBrazil has the second largest mangrove area in the world, housing 700,000 hectares of mangroves within the Amazonian border. Awuor Owuor and Bernardino’s study, conducted in 13 communities along the northern Amazon coast of Pará, found that the healthy functioning of mangrove forests provides essential ecosystem services for local coastal communities including: food sources, cultural activities, income, education, climate regulation, and flood control. The study also shows food sources and cultural practices are highly dependent not only on mangroves, but also on adjacent coastal upland habitats such as forests and croplands. Ultimately, this new data fills a critical gap in our understanding of the value of these mangroves and reveals that a holistic approach to conserving mangrove forests in the Global South must also consider how local communities use the resources from connected coastal upland habitats.\\n\\n“It is well documented that mangroves and coastal wetlands are significant carbon sinks, however, mangroves also provide both direct and indirect benefits such as fisheries and climate regulation to local communities which are not easy to quantify more so in data scarce regions of the world,” says Awuor Owuor, first author of the study. “In order to better understand these benefits as well as the connection between people and nature, our study combined qualitative data from interviews with the local communities and spatial maps of land use in the surrounding areas. This holistic approach not only highlights how valuable the communities find these habitats but also shows the complex connection of mangroves and upland habitats.”\\n\\nAwuor Owuor and Bernardino interviewed over 100 households to understand how people use and value mangroves, their willingness to commit their time to mangrove conservation, and the economic significance of this ecosystem.\\n\\n“This study has significant implications for decision-making around any economic activity in the Brazilian Amazon that can threaten the existence or the habitat quality of mangroves in the region, as we can directly link mangrove health to multiple ecosystem services provided to communities who live nearby, ” says Bernardino. “When we look at the flow of ecosystem benefits, their value to the local, coastal communities is evident, but these communities are among the most marginalized in the country and the social, economic and cultural benefits of mangroves are often not understood or valued outside their communities.”\\n\\nAwuor Owuor and Bernardino’s efforts to understand the socioeconomic and ecological value of Brazilian mangroves is part of the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition, a multi-year, comprehensive exploration of the Amazon River which spans the entire basin, from the Andes to the Atlantic.\\n\\n“A unique component of the Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition is that it combines science, storytelling and local collaboration to illuminate and protect understudied ecosystems,” says Nicole Alexiev, Vice President of Science and Innovation Programs at National Geographic Society. “The work that Margaret and Angelo are leading in Brazil also demonstrates the critical role local communities play in devising these important conservation solutions.”\\n\\nMEDIA KIT\\n\\nImages\\n\\n###\\n\\nABOUT PERPETUAL PLANET EXPEDITIONS\\n\\nThe National Geographic Perpetual Planet Expeditions program, a long-standing collaboration with Rolex and its Perpetual Planet Initiative, supports expeditions to explore the planet’s most critical environments. By harnessing world-renowned scientific expertise and cutting-edge technology that reveal new insights about the systems that are vital to life on Earth, these expeditions help scientists, decision-makers, and local communities plan for and find solutions to the impacts of climate and environmental change while illuminating the wonder of our world through impactful storytelling.\\n\\nABOUT ROLEX’S PERPETUAL PLANET INITIATIVE\\n\\nFor nearly a century, Rolex has supported pioneering explorers pushing back the boundaries of human endeavour. The company has moved from championing exploration for the sake of discovery to protecting the planet, committing for the long term to support individuals and organizations using science to understand and devise solutions to today’s environmental challenges.\\n\\nThis engagement was reinforced with the launch of the Perpetual Planet initiative in 2019, which initially focused on individuals who contribute to a better world through the Rolex Awards for Enterprise, on safeguarding the oceans as part of an established association with Mission Blue and on understanding climate change via its long-standing partnership with the National Geographic Society.\\n\\nThe initiative’s portfolio continues to expand with more than 20 partners including:\\n\\nCristina Mittermeier and Paul Nicklen in their work as conservation photographers; Coral Gardeners, transplanting resilient corals to reefs; the Under The Pole expeditions, pushing the boundaries of underwater exploration; the B.I.G North expedition to the Canadian Arctic in 2024, gathering data on threats to the Arctic.\\n\\nRolex also supports organizations and initiatives fostering the next generations of explorers, scientists and conservationists through scholarships and grants, such as Our World-Underwater Scholarship Society and The Rolex Explorers Club Grants.',\n",

              "'Em português\\n\\nWashington, D.C. (Feb. 7) — Released today, a new study provides the first-ever empirical assessment of ecosystem services — the benefits we receive from nature — of Brazilian mangroves. The study, titled “Flow of mangrove ecosystem services to coastal communities in the Brazilian Amazon” published by Frontiers in Environmental Science and co-authored by National Geographic Explorers Margaret Awuor Owuor and Angelo Bernardino, gives evidence of the critical environmental, social, economic, and cultural value mangroves hold for coastal communities.\\n\\nBrazil has the second largest mangrove area in the world, housing 700,000 hectares of mangroves within the Amazonian border. Awuor Owuor and Bernardino’s study, conducted in 13 communities along the northern Amazon coast of Pará, found that the healthy functioning of mangrove forests provides essential ecosystem services for local coastal communities including: food sources, cultural activities, income, education, climate regulation, and flood control. The study also shows food sources and cultural practices are highly dependent not only on mangroves, but also on adjacent coastal upland habitats such as forests and croplands. Ultimately, this new data fills a critical gap in our understanding of the value of these mangroves and reveals that a holistic approach to conserving mangrove forests in the Global South must also consider how local communities use the resources from connected coastal upland habitats.\\n\\n“It is well documented that mangroves and coastal wetlands are significant carbon sinks, however, mangroves also provide both direct and indirect benefits such as fisheries and climate regulation to local communities which are not easy to quantify more so in data scarce regions of the world,” says Awuor Owuor, first author of the study. “In order to better understand these benefits as well as the connection between people and nature, our study combined qualitative data from interviews with the local communities and spatial maps of land use in the surrounding areas. This holistic approach not only highlights how valuable the communities find these habitats but also shows the complex connection of mangroves and upland habitats.”\\n\\nAwuor Owuor and Bernardino interviewed over 100 households to understand how people use and value mangroves, their willingness to commit their time to mangrove conservation, and the economic significance of this ecosystem.\\n\\n“This study has significant implications for decision-making around any economic activity in the Brazilian Amazon that can threaten the existence or the habitat quality of mangroves in the region, as we can directly link mangrove health to multiple ecosystem services provided to communities who live nearby, ” says Bernardino. “When we look at the flow of ecosystem benefits, their value to the local, coastal communities is evident, but these communities are among the most marginalized in the country and the social, economic and cultural benefits of mangroves are often not understood or valued outside their communities.”\\n\\nAwuor Owuor and Bernardino’s efforts to understand the socioeconomic and ecological value of Brazilian mangroves is part of the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition, a multi-year, comprehensive exploration of the Amazon River which spans the entire basin, from the Andes to the Atlantic.\\n\\n“A unique component of the Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition is that it combines science, storytelling and local collaboration to illuminate and protect understudied ecosystems,” says Nicole Alexiev, Vice President of Science and Innovation Programs at National Geographic Society. “The work that Margaret and Angelo are leading in Brazil also demonstrates the critical role local communities play in devising these important conservation solutions.”\\n\\nMEDIA KIT\\n\\nImages\\n\\n###\\n\\nABOUT PERPETUAL PLANET EXPEDITIONS\\n\\nThe National Geographic Perpetual Planet Expeditions program, a long-standing collaboration with Rolex and its Perpetual Planet Initiative, supports expeditions to explore the planet’s most critical environments. By harnessing world-renowned scientific expertise and cutting-edge technology that reveal new insights about the systems that are vital to life on Earth, these expeditions help scientists, decision-makers, and local communities plan for and find solutions to the impacts of climate and environmental change while illuminating the wonder of our world through impactful storytelling.\\n\\nABOUT ROLEX’S PERPETUAL PLANET INITIATIVE\\n\\nFor nearly a century, Rolex has supported pioneering explorers pushing back the boundaries of human endeavour. The company has moved from championing exploration for the sake of discovery to protecting the planet, committing for the long term to support individuals and organizations using science to understand and devise solutions to today’s environmental challenges.\\n\\nThis engagement was reinforced with the launch of the Perpetual Planet initiative in 2019, which initially focused on individuals who contribute to a better world through the Rolex Awards for Enterprise, on safeguarding the oceans as part of an established association with Mission Blue and on understanding climate change via its long-standing partnership with the National Geographic Society.\\n\\nThe initiative’s portfolio continues to expand with more than 20 partners including:\\n\\nCristina Mittermeier and Paul Nicklen in their work as conservation photographers; Coral Gardeners, transplanting resilient corals to reefs; the Under The Pole expeditions, pushing the boundaries of underwater exploration; the B.I.G North expedition to the Canadian Arctic in 2024, gathering data on threats to the Arctic.\\n\\nRolex also supports organizations and initiatives fostering the next generations of explorers, scientists and conservationists through scholarships and grants, such as Our World-Underwater Scholarship Society and The Rolex Explorers Club Grants.'"

Degraded mangrove areas between 1975 and 2020 were identified using Landsat images and field verification of the specific sites. The SBR was divided into 5609 grids using a 1 km grid to understand the nature of mangrove degradation and modeling purpose (Fig. 3). Landsat MSS (1975) and Landsat 8 OLI (2020) satellite data were utilized for preparing a land use/landcover map of the SBR using a supervised classification technique. The classification accuracy was assessed through the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient. Overall accuracy was found 87.62% for 1975 and 94.9% for 2020 and the kappa coefficient values was 0.89 for 1975 and 0.96 for 2020. Post classification change matrix technique was used to prepare land use/land cover change map during 1975 and 2020. The area under vegetation cover and mangrove was extracted from the land use land cover map. NDVI maps during different seasons were utilized to improve the accuracy of the vegetation cover map of the SBR. Ten influencing drivers were selected for analyzing the habitat suitability of mangrove forests (Table 1). The details of the methodological framework are presented in Fig. 2.\\n\\nTable 1 Major drivers of mangrove degradation in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. Full size table\\n\\nFigure 2 Methodological framework of the study. Full size image\\n\\nOccurrence data\\n\\nWe selected 18 dominant mangrove species in Indian Sundarban for preparing a habitat suitability model (Table 2). The occurrence data of the selected mangrove species have been collected from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the existing published literature68,69. The occurrence data were collected from the published sources70,71,72,73,74 and field survey using a grid-based stratified random sampling approach during 2018\\u20132019. We received help from the local fisherman, crab and honey collector to identify mangrove species and collected samples from the core forest areas. The total grids were divided into 19 strata as per the administrative blocks for an easy process and 50 samples were selected from each stratum. In this way, a total of 950 occurrence locations were selected from the field survey (Fig. 3). The secondary occurrence data was verified through google earth images to avoid duplication. Further, the occurrence data was run through a statistical assessment using spatially rarefied in ArcGIS SDM toolbox by selecting a single point grid cell for individual species (1 km grid). Finally, we selected a total of 1560 occurrence data (707 from the archive sources and 853 from the field survey (Table 2) to develop species distribution models.\\n\\nTable 2 Details of the selected mangrove species and the occurrence data. Full size table\\n\\nFigure 3 A grid-based field survey (2018\\u20132019) has been conducted to collect the species occurrence data of 18 mangrove species. (The satellite images are obtained from the ArcGIS google earth base map. The species occurrence locations were collected through Garmin eTrex 32 \\u00d7 Outdoor Handheld GPS and the maps were prepared using ArcGIS 10.8.2 software [https://desktop.arcgis.com].) Full size image\\n\\nData preparation and variable selection\\n\\nAfter a detailed literature review and field knowledge, we considered 36 variables from 6 different parameters for the present study. The data source, data structure, spatial resolution, and references of the data have been provided in Appendix 1. All the raster variables were re-sampled into 1 km resolution using resample tool in ArcGIS to match the original resolution of WorldClim data and the 1 km sampling grid76. All 30-m raster images were reclassified into 1 km grid cell and the average number of pixels over 5609 girds in Sundarban were determined to be 33,334. From the topographical parameters, we selected six important variables (Appendix 2A) namely, elevation, slope, curvature, geomorphology, topographic wetness index (TWI), and stream power index (SPI) (Appendix 1). All the selected topographical variables were intricately linked with the tidal inundation and temperature, which can directly influence the distribution of mangrove species77. From environmental parameters, 6 variables (Appendix 2B) were selected namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), level of flood inundation, mean tidal range, storm surge height, normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and rate of erosion/accretion (Appendix 1). Mangroves are known as salt-tolerant higher groups of coastal plants78 which are mainly flourish in the backwater, estuaries, creeks, and lagoons. These flowering plants are inundated and exposed two times a day during high tide and low tide with coastal marine water and grow up by the mixture of the freshwater flow from upstream. Thus, water is a very important parameter for assessing mangrove habitat suitability. Six variables were selected as underwater parameters namely water surface temperature, water salinity, PH value, distance from water, drainage density, and modified normalized difference water index (Appendix 2C). All these variables are directly associated with the growth and distribution of mangrove species in Sundarban (Appendix 1). Soil is considered an influencing parameter along with climate for the distribution of flora at spatial scales1,79. However, few studies have considered soil variables in modeling mangrove distribution52. Six important variables namely soil texture, soil salinity index, soil fertility index, sediment yield factor (Ton), electronic conductivity (EC), and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI) were selected to examine the influence of soil (Appendix 2D).\\n\\nBioclimatic layers are one of the popular variables widely used by various scholars in order to build species distribution and ecological niche modeling80. Many researchers have also used the bioclimatic variables for mangrove habitat suitability models because of their association with climate-related phenomena, especially temperature and precipitation81. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to remove the data redundancy and avoid the random error and uncertainty of the model (Appendix 3). Of the 19 variables only the most suitable 6 bioclimatic variable layers were used for this study: BIO1, Annual Mean Temperature; BIO2, Mean Diurnal Range; BIO3, Isothermality; BIO4, Temperature Seasonality, BIO12 = Annual Precipitation and BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Appendix 2E) Anthropogenic activities are the main factors for the decrease in areas under mangroves globally82, Sundarban is no exception to this encroachment. Six disturbance variables namely distance from the road, road density, distance from Settlement, population density, distance from agriculture field, and embankment density were selected for habitat suitability analysis based on local knowledge (Appendix 2F).\\n\\nVariable performance for habitat suitability model\\n\\nModel collinearity among the variables was checked to avoid the negative influence of variables on the performance of the model. The predictive ability of all individual variables was tested before performing the suitability model83. The linear support vector machine (LSVM) model was utilized for assessing the prediction capacity of variables. LSVM can be expressed as:\\n\\n$$g(x)=Sgn({w}^{T}a+b)$$\\n\\nwhere, \\\\({w}^{T}\\\\) is the weight matrix of the habitat suitability variables, \\\\(a=\\\\) (a 1 , a 2 \\u2026a 14 ) vector inputs of the variables, \\\\(b\\\\) is the offset from the origin of the hyper-plane. The variables ith with the weight \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\) close to 0 has a smaller effect on the prediction than the one with larger values of \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\). The average merit (AM) for each variable and its ability for prediction ranged between 1 and 10 (Table 3). The values > 5 represent the potential influencing variables for habitat suitability model.\\n\\nTable 3 Intrinsic and extrinsic model evaluation scores for each species. Full size table\\n\\nModel development and validation\\n\\nThe habitat suitability models for 18 selected mangrove species were constructed using ten algorithms through the biomod2 package in R studio. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models can be set up in the R studio package for getting different complex conditions and properties which can give a possible higher accuracy on the species distribution model84. For the present study, we performed 10-machine learning algorithms: (1) MAXENT: Maximum Entropy; (2) GLM: Generalized Linear Model; (3) MARS: Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines; (4) GAM: Generalized Additive Model; (5) RF: Random Forest; (6) GBM: Boosted Regression Trees model; (7) CTA: Classification Tree Analysis, (8) ANN: Artificial Neural Network; (9) FDA: Flexible Discriminant Analysis and (10) SRE: Surface Range Envelop model. The performance of all ten models has been assessed through the intrinsic model building process and extrinsic validation methods. For this, we have split the occurrence data into 80% for training and 20% for testing the model. For creating the intrinsic model, we randomly used 75% of the occurrence data for training the model and the remaining 25% for testing each individual model. The modeling process was run for 18 different species using 10 machine learning algorithms. In this way, 180 models were run. Cohen's Kappa (KAPPA), true skill statistic (TSS), and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) models were used for validated all the individual models.\\n\\nFinally, for the extrinsic evaluation, the algorithms which have > 0.75 predicting performance for all the validation models (KAPPA, TSS, and ROC) were used to build the final ensemble model (Appendix 4). We have used the ensemble forecast method using a weighted mean approach in biomod2 packages within R studio for producing the final habitat suitability models for all the selected species. The final habitat suitability models for all 18 species were again validated through the Boyce index (BI) using the 20% data which were kept aside for validation85 (Table 3). The output habitat suitability raster index from the ensemble models for all species was then categorized into four classes namely highly suitable, moderately suitable, slightly suitable, and not suitable.\\n\\nNiche overlap analysis and setting restoration prioritization\\n\\nModified Hellinger metric (I) and Schoener's index of niche breadth (D) were used to estimate the niche overlap among 18 species. The spatial similarity and dissimilarity of niche area for the selected species has been calculate using the raster calculator spatial overlay function in ArcGIS.\\n\\nWe have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to prepare a restoration priority rank for all 18 species based on their niche characteristics, estimated potential distribution, local knowledge, and degradation status.\\n\\nIdentification of restoration prioritize grids\\n\\nPercentage of niche overlap data, restoration priority rank for all species, habitat suitability maps for all individual species, percentage of mangrove cover, mangrove degradation rate, mangrove accretion rate, and human disturbance rate were used as input functions for identifying the restoration prioritized grids over 5609 girds in Sundarban. Grid-wise total mangrove area for the present scenario was calculated from the land use/land cover map for 2020. A grid-wise mangrove degradation rate and mangrove accretion rate have been calculated using the land use land cover change between 1975 and 2020. The human disturbance rate was calculated using the following equation:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{HDR}=\\\\frac{(BR+NP+RD+AR)}{1km}*100$$\\n\\nwhere HDR is the human disturbance rate, BR is the percentage of built-up area in each grid, NP is the number of populations in each grid, RD = road density in each grid and AR is the percentage of agricultural area in each grid.\\n\\nFor the preparation of final restoration prioritize grids we developed a species-wise grid-based algorithm using the FactomineR package in R studio. The final output of the species level restoration prioritize grids were assessed by using negative and positive indicators function. The negative indicators included: (1) > 80% present mangrove cover grid in 2020, (2) HDR value more than > 75%, (3) not suitable and slightly suitable grids, (4) natural accretion rate as > 75%. The positive indicators for this algorithm involved: (1) restoration priority rank for each individual species, (2) niche overlap grid for each individual species (P < 0.05), (3) highly and moderately suitability grids for each individual species, (4) degradation date > 75%.\",\n          \"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies .

Credit: Maruyama Mori/IB-CLP-UNESP\\n\\nIn Brazil's North region, members of the population of red mangrove trees (Rhizophora mangle) do not often meet relatives from the South and vice-versa. However, occasional migrations via ocean currents between the two regions involving propagules, seeds adapted to seawater, enable populations to exchange genetic material and remain connected during their evolution.\\n\\nThis is one of the conclusions of a study reported in the journal Molecular Ecology Resources by Brazilian and Japanese researchers.\\n\\nMangrove forests form a unique wetland ecosystem, inhabiting the edge of land and sea, rooted and thriving in seawater. Mangroves play a vital role in coastal ecology and in sustaining and securing coastal communities.\\n\\nRhizophora is one of the main mangrove genera, found in all regions of the planet, and red mangrove is distributed in estuarine ecosystems throughout the tropics. Transoceanic dispersal and the cosmopolitan presence of the genus make it a good model for in-depth analysis of coastal ecology. Studies of red mangroves in Brazil can also help prioritize conservation areas, as they are important nurseries for various marine species and store large amounts of carbon.\\n\\n\\\"Research along these lines helps identify places where mangroves are releasing many propagules in both the North and Northeast and the South and Southeast of Brazil. It could be worthwhile creating conservation units in these areas,\\\" said Andr\\u00e9 Guilherme Madeira, first author of the article.\\n\\n\\\"We collected DNA samples from trees of the species all over Brazil. The genetic data matched simulations of ocean currents, which also showed that propagules aren't carried very far from their parent mangroves. In sum, we have two practically isolated populations, one in the North/Northeast and the other in the South/Southeast,\\\" said Gustavo Maruyama Mori, last author of the article and a professor at IB-CLP-UNESP.\\n\\nThe study served as the basis for the project \\\"Evaluating adaptation, epigenetic variation, and dispersal to unveil the response of mangrove in a changing world.\\\"\\n\\nCross-referenced data\\n\\nMangrove propagules are not in fact seeds properly speaking, but embryos that become fully mature plants before dropping off the parent tree. They are dispersed by water until they embed in the shallows. They can survive for about a year in saltwater, freshwater or brackish water before germinating. In Rhizophora, they are green, cylindrical and pointed. They are commonly found floating in the sea near beaches in Brazil.\\n\\nUsing mathematical models of floating and ten-year ocean current data, the researchers simulated propagule dispersal at 11 sites along the coast of Brazil, from Salin\\u00f3polis, Par\\u00e1 state, in the North to Florian\\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina state, in the South. In the simulations, propagules were assumed to germinate whenever they stopped on the coast in the period 2010-20.\\n\\n\\\"Red mangrove populations in Brazil are fairly isolated. They don't communicate with each other. However, one or another propagule occasionally reaches an ocean current that takes it farther than usual. These long-distance dispersal events are rare but can be significant,\\\" Madeira said.\\n\\nThe hypothesis was compatible with the genetic data, which showed an ancestral connection between the populations on a scale of thousands of years but little or none in recent generations.\\n\\nOther more variable factors, such as coastal currents and air dispersal of pollen, may contribute to an exchange of genetic material between populations, complementing the hypothesis, but data is not available for these parameters in the populations analyzed to confirm the possibility.\\n\\nThe researchers now plan to apply the same approach to mangroves in other parts of the world, this time cross-referencing data from oceanographic simulations with molecular data for mangroves compiled by other research groups, in order to understand whether the findings for Brazil are part of a global pattern or only local.\\n\\n\\\"Given that mangroves everywhere in the world are made up of species in relatively few genera, we want to test certain particularities of each one. Rhizophora, for example, fructifies all year round, whereas propagules of Avicennia can be found only at certain times. Moreover, ocean currents vary from one year to another. These differences may help us understand how mangroves are formed and how each factor contributes to the process. We want to understand the roles of all these variables,\\\" Mori said.\\n\\nMore information: Andr\\u00e9 Guilherme Madeira et al, The role of oceanic currents in the dispersal and connectivity of the mangrove Rhizophora mangle on the Southwest Atlantic region, Molecular Ecology Resources (2023).

Trees assigned to cluster FC-K1 were primarily associated with the seaward fringe, whereas individuals assigned to FC-K2 were located more in the interior of the parcel. Limited genetic structure was observed across the four mangrove stands separated by 6\\u2013115 km in the Honduran Caribbean. However, subsequent analyses, with mangroves from Fort Cay grouped by their K-means clustering assignment, demonstrated that this pattern was caused primarily by the relationship among individuals situated along the seaward fringe and individuals at the other sites. Much greater genetic differentiation was observed between mangroves located in the interior of Fort Cay and the other sites. This suggests high levels of connectivity between mangroves along shorelines, which has been previously observed24, but that the hypothesis of low or limited genetic structure at fine-scales within R. mangle forests should be rejected. The significant genetic differentiation observed among individuals assigned to cluster FC-K2 on Fort Cay compared to all other sites, suggests at least two recruitment events from distinct sources have occurred within the Fort Cay parcel.\\n\\nFine-scale genetic structure\\n\\nOur analysis of a small parcel of mangrove forest revealed significant genetic structure at fine spatial scales, with two genetically distinct clusters of trees identified in STRUCTURE and assigned through K-means clustering. Our findings provide evidence that refute the hypothesis that (R. mangle) mangrove forests lack genetic structure13, with significant genetic differences occurring at 8\\u201310 m scales. We observed significant positive spatial autocorrelation at 2 m spatial scales, at 2\\u20138 m distance classes, and significant negative genetic spatial autocorrelation at 10\\u201318 m distance classes. These results indicate that individual clusters have a spatial dominance of 2\\u20138 m, and trees outside of this boundary are significantly different and potentially from different sources, either from distinct parental families within the same forest or from spatially distant sources.\\n\\nWe suggest that the genetic structure observed, both in genetic spatial autocorrelation and pairwise F ST analyses, could be the result of at least two different propagule sources which have recruited into this section of forest. The mangrove fringe, where wind and wave abatement primarily occurs, is the most dynamic area during storm events, and the part of the forest that suffers the most damage28 and provides protection to mangroves deeper within these systems. When the fringe is damaged by storms, there is the potential for recruitment of propagules from both local and distant sources, as storm waters are important drivers of mangrove dispersal and can facilitate long distance dispersal and range expansion of mangroves29. A total of 52 tropical storm and hurricane events have passed within 50 nautical miles of Fort Cay, from 1852 to 2016 (up to the time of sampling)30, the most severe was hurricane Mitch in 1998, which caused various levels of damage to mangrove stands throughout the Bay Islands, Honduras31. Such events could have had a role in shaping the genetic structure observed in the parcel of mangrove on Fort Cay. Damage to the fringe from tropical storms or hurricanes could have opened space for the recruitment of propagules from other populations that were dispersed by the storm event to the parcel. However, dispersal alone does not equate to recruitment success, as recruitment is influenced by numerous biotic and abiotic factors, including propagule predation rates32, sediment conditions33, and the presence of canopy gaps28,34. The sources and the mechanism of these different recruitment events is unknown, but with trees of various sizes associated with each of the identified clusters present, we suggest recruitment has persisted over various temporal and spatial scales. Whilst defining the drivers and spatial and temporal scales of dispersal and recruitment events are beyond the scope of this study, our results identify the influence of potential recruitment events, from either proximal or distal sources, on genetic diversity and structure at fine scales.\\n\\nLarge-scale genetic structure\\n\\nLimited genetic structure was observed in R. mangle forests between the four sampling sites within the Honduran Caribbean, at spatial scales of 6\\u2013115 km. These results suggest high levels of connectivity among mangroves within the Honduran Caribbean, and mirror findings from previous studies on both R. mangle and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) in the Mesoamerican Reef region and Gulf of Mexico, at scales of 100\\u2019s km35. A more recent study observed greater genetic structure between R. mangle stands located between these two ecoregions, but, limited genetic structure within an ecoregion, at spatial scales of 10\\u2019s to 100\\u2019s km19. By placing the two clusters identified in Fort Cay in a wider context of R. mangle forests from across the Honduran Caribbean, we suggest that the connectivity observed at large-scales in many studies is potentially an artifact of sampling design. Mangroves assigned to cluster FC-K1 were predominantly associated with the seaward fringe of the parcel, and were most genetically similar to the three other sampling sites, where samples had also been collected from the seaward fringe. In contrast, individuals assigned to cluster FC-K2 were associated with the greatest levels of genetic differentiation to R. mangle trees sampled from the seaward fringe, including FC-K1. The limited genetic structure at the larger scale may be explained by propagules being dispersed by prevailing currents and recruiting along the seaward fringe, as propagules are capable of dispersing 1000\\u2019s km1,36. Similarly, larval models have demonstrated high levels of connectivity for other marine species in the region37. Alternatively, individuals assigned to FC-K1 may represent local recruitment and individuals of FC-K2 represent recruitment from another unknown population. Due to the higher frequency of individuals assigned to cluster FC-K1, local recruitment may be dominant, but interspersed with recruitment events from other more distant populations, and that layers of these events build up as the forest matures. We can only hypothesize about the drivers of the genetic structure observed, however, we can state unequivocally that sampling only the seaward fringe of a mangrove stand does not provide a complete overview of genetic structure of mangroves at larger spatial scales, and may greatly influence our interpretation of genetic connectivity within these ecosystems.\\n\\nManagement and restoration implications\\n\\nGenetic structure has implications for ecosystem function and the composition of associated biodiversity17,38,39. Maintaining genetic diversity within mangroves (and other ecosystems) is of increasing importance during an era of unprecedented climate change, and therefore population genetics should be an essential component of management and restoration frameworks27,40,41. To improve management and conservation efforts it is essential to have a greater understanding of the genetic structure of mangroves at the forest and seascape scale, and to ensure that management occurs at the appropriate spatial scales. Previous population genetic studies have increased our understanding of dispersal mechanisms and connectivity of mangrove populations (see Van der Stocken et al.42), and sampling scales of 5\\u201330 m18,19,43,44, and up to 100 m45 have prevented sampling the same individual multiple times. However, most of these studies also only sampled along the seaward fringe of the mangrove. Our findings suggest that such sampling ranges are adequate, but based on the genetic structure observed here (i.e., positive spatial autocorrelation up to 8 m) we recommend sampling at similar spatial scales, 10\\u201330 m, into the interior of mangrove forests. Sampling inland, not just along, a coastline will provide greater representation of the genetic structure within a population. This in turn can inform the spatial scale required for effective management of mangroves across seascapes, and can be used to monitor the effectiveness of restoration projects in maintaining genetic diversity, which are fundamental to the success of forest management40,41, and restoration frameworks (see Mijangos et al.27). Maintaining genetic diversity and gene flow of restored forests is a critical step in building resistance, resilience and adaptation of restored mangroves to future environmental conditions46. Understanding the genetic structure of mangroves at the forest scale can also help inform propagule source selection and planting practices, where required. This study provides further evidence of how genetic and genomic tools can improve the monitoring and evaluation of the management and restoration of mangroves47,48.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Degraded mangrove areas between 1975 and 2020 were identified using Landsat images and field verification of the specific sites. The SBR was divided into 5609 grids using a 1 km grid to understand the nature of mangrove degradation and modeling purpose (Fig. 3). Landsat MSS (1975) and Landsat 8 OLI (2020) satellite data were utilized for preparing a land use/landcover map of the SBR using a supervised classification technique. The classification accuracy was assessed through the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient. Overall accuracy was found 87.62% for 1975 and 94.9% for 2020 and the kappa coefficient values was 0.89 for 1975 and 0.96 for 2020. Post classification change matrix technique was used to prepare land use/land cover change map during 1975 and 2020. The area under vegetation cover and mangrove was extracted from the land use land cover map. NDVI maps during different seasons were utilized to improve the accuracy of the vegetation cover map of the SBR. Ten influencing drivers were selected for analyzing the habitat suitability of mangrove forests (Table 1). The details of the methodological framework are presented in Fig. 2.  Table 1 Major drivers of mangrove degradation in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. Full size table  Figure 2 Methodological framework of the study. Full size image  Occurrence data  We selected 18 dominant mangrove species in Indian Sundarban for preparing a habitat suitability model (Table 2). The occurrence data of the selected mangrove species have been collected from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the existing published literature68,69. The occurrence data were collected from the published sources70,71,72,73,74 and field survey using a grid-based stratified random sampling approach during 2018\\u20132019. We received help from the local fisherman, crab and honey collector to identify mangrove species and collected samples from the core forest areas. The total grids were divided into 19 strata as per the administrative blocks for an easy process and 50 samples were selected from each stratum. In this way, a total of 950 occurrence locations were selected from the field survey (Fig. 3). The secondary occurrence data was verified through google earth images to avoid duplication. Further, the occurrence data was run through a statistical assessment using spatially rarefied in ArcGIS SDM toolbox by selecting a single point grid cell for individual species (1 km grid). Finally, we selected a total of 1560 occurrence data (707 from the archive sources and 853 from the field survey (Table 2) to develop species distribution models.  Table 2 Details of the selected mangrove species and the occurrence data. Full size table  Figure 3 A grid-based field survey (2018\\u20132019) has been conducted to collect the species occurrence data of 18 mangrove species. (The satellite images are obtained from the ArcGIS google earth base map. The species occurrence locations were collected through Garmin eTrex 32 \\u00d7 Outdoor Handheld GPS and the maps were prepared using ArcGIS 10.8.2 software [https://desktop.arcgis.com].) Full size image  Data preparation and variable selection  After a detailed literature review and field knowledge, we considered 36 variables from 6 different parameters for the present study. The data source, data structure, spatial resolution, and references of the data have been provided in Appendix 1. All the raster variables were re-sampled into 1 km resolution using resample tool in ArcGIS to match the original resolution of WorldClim data and the 1 km sampling grid76. All 30-m raster images were reclassified into 1 km grid cell and the average number of pixels over 5609 girds in Sundarban were determined to be 33,334. From the topographical parameters, we selected six important variables (Appendix 2A) namely, elevation, slope, curvature, geomorphology, topographic wetness index (TWI), and stream power index (SPI) (Appendix 1). All the selected topographical variables were intricately linked with the tidal inundation and temperature, which can directly influence the distribution of mangrove species77. From environmental parameters, 6 variables (Appendix 2B) were selected namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), level of flood inundation, mean tidal range, storm surge height, normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and rate of erosion/accretion (Appendix 1). Mangroves are known as salt-tolerant higher groups of coastal plants78 which are mainly flourish in the backwater, estuaries, creeks, and lagoons. These flowering plants are inundated and exposed two times a day during high tide and low tide with coastal marine water and grow up by the mixture of the freshwater flow from upstream. Thus, water is a very important parameter for assessing mangrove habitat suitability. Six variables were selected as underwater parameters namely water surface temperature, water salinity, PH value, distance from water, drainage density, and modified normalized difference water index (Appendix 2C). All these variables are directly associated with the growth and distribution of mangrove species in Sundarban (Appendix 1). Soil is considered an influencing parameter along with climate for the distribution of flora at spatial scales1,79. However, few studies have considered soil variables in modeling mangrove distribution52. Six important variables namely soil texture, soil salinity index, soil fertility index, sediment yield factor (Ton), electronic conductivity (EC), and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI) were selected to examine the influence of soil (Appendix 2D).  Bioclimatic layers are one of the popular variables widely used by various scholars in order to build species distribution and ecological niche modeling80. Many researchers have also used the bioclimatic variables for mangrove habitat suitability models because of their association with climate-related phenomena, especially temperature and precipitation81. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to remove the data redundancy and avoid the random error and uncertainty of the model (Appendix 3). Of the 19 variables only the most suitable 6 bioclimatic variable layers were used for this study: BIO1, Annual Mean Temperature; BIO2, Mean Diurnal Range; BIO3, Isothermality; BIO4, Temperature Seasonality, BIO12 = Annual Precipitation and BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Appendix 2E) Anthropogenic activities are the main factors for the decrease in areas under mangroves globally82, Sundarban is no exception to this encroachment. Six disturbance variables namely distance from the road, road density, distance from Settlement, population density, distance from agriculture field, and embankment density were selected for habitat suitability analysis based on local knowledge (Appendix 2F).  Variable performance for habitat suitability model  Model collinearity among the variables was checked to avoid the negative influence of variables on the performance of the model. The predictive ability of all individual variables was tested before performing the suitability model83. The linear support vector machine (LSVM) model was utilized for assessing the prediction capacity of variables. LSVM can be expressed as:  $$g(x)=Sgn({w}^{T}a+b)$$  where, \\\\({w}^{T}\\\\) is the weight matrix of the habitat suitability variables, \\\\(a=\\\\) (a 1 , a 2 \\u2026a 14 ) vector inputs of the variables, \\\\(b\\\\) is the offset from the origin of the hyper-plane. The variables ith with the weight \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\) close to 0 has a smaller effect on the prediction than the one with larger values of \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\). The average merit (AM) for each variable and its ability for prediction ranged between 1 and 10 (Table 3). The values > 5 represent the potential influencing variables for habitat suitability model.  Table 3 Intrinsic and extrinsic model evaluation scores for each species. Full size table  Model development and validation  The habitat suitability models for 18 selected mangrove species were constructed using ten algorithms through the biomod2 package in R studio. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models can be set up in the R studio package for getting different complex conditions and properties which can give a possible higher accuracy on the species distribution model84. For the present study, we performed 10-machine learning algorithms: (1) MAXENT: Maximum Entropy; (2) GLM: Generalized Linear Model; (3) MARS: Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines; (4) GAM: Generalized Additive Model; (5) RF: Random Forest; (6) GBM: Boosted Regression Trees model; (7) CTA: Classification Tree Analysis, (8) ANN: Artificial Neural Network; (9) FDA: Flexible Discriminant Analysis and (10) SRE: Surface Range Envelop model. The performance of all ten models has been assessed through the intrinsic model building process and extrinsic validation methods. For this, we have split the occurrence data into 80% for training and 20% for testing the model. For creating the intrinsic model, we randomly used 75% of the occurrence data for training the model and the remaining 25% for testing each individual model. The modeling process was run for 18 different species using 10 machine learning algorithms. In this way, 180 models were run. Cohen's Kappa (KAPPA), true skill statistic (TSS), and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) models were used for validated all the individual models.  Finally, for the extrinsic evaluation, the algorithms which have > 0.75 predicting performance for all the validation models (KAPPA, TSS, and ROC) were used to build the final ensemble model (Appendix 4). We have used the ensemble forecast method using a weighted mean approach in biomod2 packages within R studio for producing the final habitat suitability models for all the selected species. The final habitat suitability models for all 18 species were again validated through the Boyce index (BI) using the 20% data which were kept aside for validation85 (Table 3). The output habitat suitability raster index from the ensemble models for all species was then categorized into four classes namely highly suitable, moderately suitable, slightly suitable, and not suitable.  Niche overlap analysis and setting restoration prioritization  Modified Hellinger metric (I) and Schoener's index of niche breadth (D) were used to estimate the niche overlap among 18 species. The spatial similarity and dissimilarity of niche area for the selected species has been calculate using the raster calculator spatial overlay function in ArcGIS.  We have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to prepare a restoration priority rank for all 18 species based on their niche characteristics, estimated potential distribution, local knowledge, and degradation status.  Identification of restoration prioritize grids  Percentage of niche overlap data, restoration priority rank for all species, habitat suitability maps for all individual species, percentage of mangrove cover, mangrove degradation rate, mangrove accretion rate, and human disturbance rate were used as input functions for identifying the restoration prioritized grids over 5609 girds in Sundarban. Grid-wise total mangrove area for the present scenario was calculated from the land use/land cover map for 2020. A grid-wise mangrove degradation rate and mangrove accretion rate have been calculated using the land use land cover change between 1975 and 2020. The human disturbance rate was calculated using the following equation:  $$\\\\mathrm{HDR}=\\\\frac{(BR+NP+RD+AR)}{1km}*100$$  where HDR is the human disturbance rate, BR is the percentage of built-up area in each grid, NP is the number of populations in each grid, RD = road density in each grid and AR is the percentage of agricultural area in each grid.  For the preparation of final restoration prioritize grids we developed a species-wise grid-based algorithm using the FactomineR package in R studio. The final output of the species level restoration prioritize grids were assessed by using negative and positive indicators function. The negative indicators included: (1) > 80% present mangrove cover grid in 2020, (2) HDR value more than > 75%, (3) not suitable and slightly suitable grids, (4) natural accretion rate as > 75%. The positive indicators for this algorithm involved: (1) restoration priority rank for each individual species, (2) niche overlap grid for each individual species (P < 0.05), (3) highly and moderately suitability grids for each individual species, (4) degradation date > 75%.\",\n          \"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Rhizophora mangle growing on the coast of S\\u00e3o Paulo; credit: Gustavo Maruyama Mori/IB-CLP-UNESP). Credit: Maruyama Mori/IB-CLP-UNESP  In Brazil's North region, members of the population of red mangrove trees (Rhizophora mangle) do not often meet relatives from the South and vice-versa. However, occasional migrations via ocean currents between the two regions involving propagules, seeds adapted to seawater, enable populations to exchange genetic material and remain connected during their evolution.  This is one of the conclusions of a study reported in the journal Molecular Ecology Resources by Brazilian and Japanese researchers.  Mangrove forests form a unique wetland ecosystem, inhabiting the edge of land and sea, rooted and thriving in seawater. Mangroves play a vital role in coastal ecology and in sustaining and securing coastal communities.  Rhizophora is one of the main mangrove genera, found in all regions of the planet, and red mangrove is distributed in estuarine ecosystems throughout the tropics. Transoceanic dispersal and the cosmopolitan presence of the genus make it a good model for in-depth analysis of coastal ecology. Studies of red mangroves in Brazil can also help prioritize conservation areas, as they are important nurseries for various marine species and store large amounts of carbon.  \\\"Research along these lines helps identify places where mangroves are releasing many propagules in both the North and Northeast and the South and Southeast of Brazil. It could be worthwhile creating conservation units in these areas,\\\" said Andr\\u00e9 Guilherme Madeira, first author of the article.  \\\"We collected DNA samples from trees of the species all over Brazil. The genetic data matched simulations of ocean currents, which also showed that propagules aren't carried very far from their parent mangroves. In sum, we have two practically isolated populations, one in the North/Northeast and the other in the South/Southeast,\\\" said Gustavo Maruyama Mori, last author of the article and a professor at IB-CLP-UNESP.  The study served as the basis for the project \\\"Evaluating adaptation, epigenetic variation, and dispersal to unveil the response of mangrove in a changing world.\\\"  Cross-referenced data  Mangrove propagules are not in fact seeds properly speaking, but embryos that become fully mature plants before dropping off the parent tree. They are dispersed by water until they embed in the shallows. They can survive for about a year in saltwater, freshwater or brackish water before germinating. In Rhizophora, they are green, cylindrical and pointed. They are commonly found floating in the sea near beaches in Brazil.  Using mathematical models of floating and ten-year ocean current data, the researchers simulated propagule dispersal at 11 sites along the coast of Brazil, from Salin\\u00f3polis, Par\\u00e1 state, in the North to Florian\\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina state, in the South. In the simulations, propagules were assumed to germinate whenever they stopped on the coast in the period 2010-20.  \\\"Red mangrove populations in Brazil are fairly isolated. They don't communicate with each other. However, one or another propagule occasionally reaches an ocean current that takes it farther than usual. These long-distance dispersal events are rare but can be significant,\\\" Madeira said.  The hypothesis was compatible with the genetic data, which showed an ancestral connection between the populations on a scale of thousands of years but little or none in recent generations.  Other more variable factors, such as coastal currents and air dispersal of pollen, may contribute to an exchange of genetic material between populations, complementing the hypothesis, but data is not available for these parameters in the populations analyzed to confirm the possibility.  The researchers now plan to apply the same approach to mangroves in other parts of the world, this time cross-referencing data from oceanographic simulations with molecular data for mangroves compiled by other research groups, in order to understand whether the findings for Brazil are part of a global pattern or only local.  \\\"Given that mangroves everywhere in the world are made up of species in relatively few genera, we want to test certain particularities of each one. Rhizophora, for example, fructifies all year round, whereas propagules of Avicennia can be found only at certain times. Moreover, ocean currents vary from one year to another. These differences may help us understand how mangroves are formed and how each factor contributes to the process. We want to understand the roles of all these variables,\\\" Mori said.

Trees assigned to cluster FC-K1 were primarily associated with the seaward fringe, whereas individuals assigned to FC-K2 were located more in the interior of the parcel. Limited genetic structure was observed across the four mangrove stands separated by 6\\u2013115 km in the Honduran Caribbean. However, subsequent analyses, with mangroves from Fort Cay grouped by their K-means clustering assignment, demonstrated that this pattern was caused primarily by the relationship among individuals situated along the seaward fringe and individuals at the other sites. Much greater genetic differentiation was observed between mangroves located in the interior of Fort Cay and the other sites. This suggests high levels of connectivity between mangroves along shorelines, which has been previously observed24, but that the hypothesis of low or limited genetic structure at fine-scales within R. mangle forests should be rejected. The significant genetic differentiation observed among individuals assigned to cluster FC-K2 on Fort Cay compared to all other sites, suggests at least two recruitment events from distinct sources have occurred within the Fort Cay parcel.  Fine-scale genetic structure  Our analysis of a small parcel of mangrove forest revealed significant genetic structure at fine spatial scales, with two genetically distinct clusters of trees identified in STRUCTURE and assigned through K-means clustering. Our findings provide evidence that refute the hypothesis that (R. mangle) mangrove forests lack genetic structure13, with significant genetic differences occurring at 8\\u201310 m scales. We observed significant positive spatial autocorrelation at 2 m spatial scales, at 2\\u20138 m distance classes, and significant negative genetic spatial autocorrelation at 10\\u201318 m distance classes. These results indicate that individual clusters have a spatial dominance of 2\\u20138 m, and trees outside of this boundary are significantly different and potentially from different sources, either from distinct parental families within the same forest or from spatially distant sources.  We suggest that the genetic structure observed, both in genetic spatial autocorrelation and pairwise F ST analyses, could be the result of at least two different propagule sources which have recruited into this section of forest. The mangrove fringe, where wind and wave abatement primarily occurs, is the most dynamic area during storm events, and the part of the forest that suffers the most damage28 and provides protection to mangroves deeper within these systems. When the fringe is damaged by storms, there is the potential for recruitment of propagules from both local and distant sources, as storm waters are important drivers of mangrove dispersal and can facilitate long distance dispersal and range expansion of mangroves29. A total of 52 tropical storm and hurricane events have passed within 50 nautical miles of Fort Cay, from 1852 to 2016 (up to the time of sampling)30, the most severe was hurricane Mitch in 1998, which caused various levels of damage to mangrove stands throughout the Bay Islands, Honduras31. Such events could have had a role in shaping the genetic structure observed in the parcel of mangrove on Fort Cay. Damage to the fringe from tropical storms or hurricanes could have opened space for the recruitment of propagules from other populations that were dispersed by the storm event to the parcel. However, dispersal alone does not equate to recruitment success, as recruitment is influenced by numerous biotic and abiotic factors, including propagule predation rates32, sediment conditions33, and the presence of canopy gaps28,34. The sources and the mechanism of these different recruitment events is unknown, but with trees of various sizes associated with each of the identified clusters present, we suggest recruitment has persisted over various temporal and spatial scales. Whilst defining the drivers and spatial and temporal scales of dispersal and recruitment events are beyond the scope of this study, our results identify the influence of potential recruitment events, from either proximal or distal sources, on genetic diversity and structure at fine scales.  Large-scale genetic structure  Limited genetic structure was observed in R. mangle forests between the four sampling sites within the Honduran Caribbean, at spatial scales of 6\\u2013115 km. These results suggest high levels of connectivity among mangroves within the Honduran Caribbean, and mirror findings from previous studies on both R. mangle and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) in the Mesoamerican Reef region and Gulf of Mexico, at scales of 100\\u2019s km35. A more recent study observed greater genetic structure between R. mangle stands located between these two ecoregions, but, limited genetic structure within an ecoregion, at spatial scales of 10\\u2019s to 100\\u2019s km19. By placing the two clusters identified in Fort Cay in a wider context of R. mangle forests from across the Honduran Caribbean, we suggest that the connectivity observed at large-scales in many studies is potentially an artifact of sampling design. Mangroves assigned to cluster FC-K1 were predominantly associated with the seaward fringe of the parcel, and were most genetically similar to the three other sampling sites, where samples had also been collected from the seaward fringe. In contrast, individuals assigned to cluster FC-K2 were associated with the greatest levels of genetic differentiation to R. mangle trees sampled from the seaward fringe, including FC-K1. The limited genetic structure at the larger scale may be explained by propagules being dispersed by prevailing currents and recruiting along the seaward fringe, as propagules are capable of dispersing 1000\\u2019s km1,36. Similarly, larval models have demonstrated high levels of connectivity for other marine species in the region37. Alternatively, individuals assigned to FC-K1 may represent local recruitment and individuals of FC-K2 represent recruitment from another unknown population. Due to the higher frequency of individuals assigned to cluster FC-K1, local recruitment may be dominant, but interspersed with recruitment events from other more distant populations, and that layers of these events build up as the forest matures. We can only hypothesize about the drivers of the genetic structure observed, however, we can state unequivocally that sampling only the seaward fringe of a mangrove stand does not provide a complete overview of genetic structure of mangroves at larger spatial scales, and may greatly influence our interpretation of genetic connectivity within these ecosystems.  Management and restoration implications  Genetic structure has implications for ecosystem function and the composition of associated biodiversity17,38,39. Maintaining genetic diversity within mangroves (and other ecosystems) is of increasing importance during an era of unprecedented climate change, and therefore population genetics should be an essential component of management and restoration frameworks27,40,41. To improve management and conservation efforts it is essential to have a greater understanding of the genetic structure of mangroves at the forest and seascape scale, and to ensure that management occurs at the appropriate spatial scales. Previous population genetic studies have increased our understanding of dispersal mechanisms and connectivity of mangrove populations (see Van der Stocken et al.42), and sampling scales of 5\\u201330 m18,19,43,44, and up to 100 m45 have prevented sampling the same individual multiple times. However, most of these studies also only sampled along the seaward fringe of the mangrove. Our findings suggest that such sampling ranges are adequate, but based on the genetic structure observed here (i.e., positive spatial autocorrelation up to 8 m) we recommend sampling at similar spatial scales, 10\\u201330 m, into the interior of mangrove forests. Sampling inland, not just along, a coastline will provide greater representation of the genetic structure within a population. This in turn can inform the spatial scale required for effective management of mangroves across seascapes, and can be used to monitor the effectiveness of restoration projects in maintaining genetic diversity, which are fundamental to the success of forest management40,41, and restoration frameworks (see Mijangos et al.27). Maintaining genetic diversity and gene flow of restored forests is a critical step in building resistance, resilience and adaptation of restored mangroves to future environmental conditions46. Understanding the genetic structure of mangroves at the forest scale can also help inform propagule source selection and planting practices, where required. This study provides further evidence of how genetic and genomic tools can improve the monitoring and evaluation of the management and restoration of mangroves47,48.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This natural wonder is not only a key tourist attraction but also plays a vital role in promoting environmental conservation and boosting local revenue.\\n\\nDuring the prime visiting months from October to February, the Sundarbans offers visitors cool river waters and pleasant weather, making it an ideal destination for exploring its unique ecosystem. Recent statistics reveal a significant uptick in tourism, with 216,143 visitors, including 2,143 international guests, in the fiscal year 2022-2023, generating Tk 3.94 crore in revenue for the government. This marks a notable increase from previous years, highlighting the forest's growing appeal and importance to Bangladesh's economy.\\n\\nAccording to data collected from the local forest office, the number of tourists was 1,89,570 in the fiscal year 2018-2019 and of them, 2,261 came from other countries. The government earned Tk 1.51 crore during this period.\\n\\nRead: Sundarbans Day in southwestern region on Feb 14; a clarion call to love, save the forest\\n\\nIn the fiscal year, 2019-2020, the number of tourists was 1,72,979. Of them 2,317 came from overseas. A total of Tk 1.87 crore was collected as revenue during this period.\",\n          \"July 04, 2023 12:09 pm | Updated 12:10 pm IST - CUDDALORE\\n\\nThe Tamil Nadu Forest Department has drawn up a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of coastal habitats by creating bio-shields, and restoring degraded mangroves in Cuddalore district. The Department has planned to restore degraded areas in Pichavaram, and increase mangrove cover in the region by 100 hectares for the year 2023-24.\\n\\nThe Pichavaram mangroves are among the most productive ecosystems in the State, and are a storehouse of biodiversity, supporting 840 species of flora and fauna. These includes 115 species of birds, 16 species of mammals, 11 amphibians, 177 species of finfish, 95 species of zooplanktons, 82 phytoplanktons, 35 species of butterflies, 17 snakes and 3 species of seagrass.\\n\\nHowever, the mangroves are under serious threat of degradation due to various factors. Realising this, the Forest Department has planned the restoration of about 350 hectares of degraded patches in Pichavaram over the next three years.\\n\\nOfficial sources said the scheme for rehabilitation of coastal habitats and creation of bio-shields is being implemented in all coastal districts, and a major portion of the work would be taken up in Killai and Pichavaram under the Green Tamil Nadu Mission.\\n\\nThe micro plan has been approved by the District Green Committee/Wetlands Committee headed by Collector A. Arun Thamburaj and sent to the State Government. New mangrove plantations will be taken up in the Uppanar River in Kudikadu village on an expanse of 25 hectares in two locations during 2023-24.\\n\\nAccording to government estimates, the mangrove cover in Tamil Nadu is 44.94 square kilometres (sq km), out of which 7.73 sq km fall in Cuddalore. Straddling the Vellar and Coleroon estuaries, about 21% of Pichavaram is occupied by waterbodies, 27% by healthy mangrove vegetation, 38% by mudflats with sparsely grown mangroves, and the rest of the area is sand dunes.\\n\\nAccording to Villupuram District Forest Officer (DFO) Sumesh Soman who holds additional charge of Cuddalore district, \\u201cAs many as 13 species of mangroves are found in Pichavaram. Of these, there are only a few individuals of species like Lumnitzera racemosa and Rhizophora annamalayana. The degradation of mangroves usually occurs as a result of high soil salinity due to irregular flushing and low tidal amplitude. The Department has planned to regenerate these two species by using scientific methods such as the canal bank planting by modified fishbone design.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Soman added, \\u201cThe fishbone model allows the water to reach every nook and corner of the field channels. This model has found success in earlier applications at Pichavaram. The Department has also planned linear planting in riverine or estuary areas where the inter-tidal area is very low, but is flushed by tidal water regularly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe have also planned the linear planting of mangroves on a 20 km stretch of the coastline from 2024 to 2026. This will be carried out for two years with a 10 km stretch each year. The planting will be taken up from Muzhukkuthurai to Mudasalodai, MGR Thittu to Chinnavaikkal and Boat House to Chinnavaikkal,\\u201d the DFO said.\\n\\nThe Department has also planned the development of a bio-shield by planting non-mangrove species such as casuarina and palmyra on 10 hectares in the current year, to protect the coast from extreme weather events such as cyclones, floods and rise in sea levels.\",\n          \"KARACHI: While the overall cover of mangroves in the Indus delta has increased over the years, Karachi continues to lose these precious \\u201cprotected\\u201d forests on account of land allotment by the Board of Revenue and the Karachi Port Trust.\\n\\nThis was shared during a briefing organised on Wednesday on the conservation of mangrove forests and their future outlook at the WWF Wetland Centre for visiting members of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change.\\n\\nLed by the committee\\u2019s chairperson Senator Seemee Ezdi, the team included Senator Dr Mohammad Hamayun Mohmand, Senator Khalida Ateeb and Senator Abida Muhammad Azeem.\\n\\nWWF Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan briefed the committee on the climate vulnerability of Pakistan and highlighted the importance of the Indus delta region and mangroves conservation.\\n\\nForest official says Indus delta mangrove cover has increased to 240,000 hectares this year\\n\\nHe shared that ecologically, mangrove forests were the top habitat for biodiversity as they created a defence system against natural disasters such as tsunami, cyclones and sea storms.\\n\\nIn his presentation, the chief conservator of the forest department, Riaz Ahmed Wagan, discussed the role of his department in the conservation of mangroves and its future outlook, including environmental and economic benefits.\\n\\nAccording to him, the mangrove cover in the Indus delta has increased from 160,000 hectares in 2010 to 240,000 hectares this year on account of the conservation, plantation and rehabilitation efforts by the forest department, World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan and International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\n\\n\\u201cUnfortunately, however, the mangroves surrounding Karachi have shrunk from 2,000 hectares in 2010 to 1,800 hectares today mainly due to land allotment,\\u201d he said, regretting that destruction of mangroves continued despite their protected status and action by the forest department against offenders.\\n\\nThe areas of the Indus delta, he pointed out, had increased due to sea intrusion from 600,000 hectares in 2010 to 667,000 hectares today.\\n\\nAbout future plans, he said the department aimed to increase the total mangrove area to 500,000 hectares in coming years.\\n\\nSenior Manager Conservation WWF Sindh Altaaf Sheikh provided the committee with a detailed overview of WWF programmes in Pakistan.\\n\\nSharing details on the mangroves conservation approach, he said that WWF Pakistan was currently working on 18 different landscapes, from mountains to mangroves.\\n\\nThe Indus delta, he told the meeting, was the fifth largest arid ecosystem and hosted the seventh largest mangrove forest in the world.\\n\\nHe described the socioeconomic aspects of the Indus delta and said that the delta contributed 98 per cent of shrimp catch and more than 77pc of marine fish catch.\\n\\nHe also spoke on the challenges of the shrinkage of the Indus delta region due to sea intrusion and soil erosion. He noted that clearing of mangrove forest land for its commercial use had worsened deforestation, leading to loss of biodiversity.\\n\\nSpeaking to the media, the visiting senators emphasised the importance of introducing and sustaining both short- and long-term nature-based solutions to encourage mangrove conservation efforts and measures that were globally known to sustain and empower such programmes for a greener future.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 12th, 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This natural wonder is not only a key tourist attraction but also plays a vital role in promoting environmental conservation and boosting local revenue.\\n\\nDuring the prime visiting months from October to February, the Sundarbans offers visitors cool river waters and pleasant weather, making it an ideal destination for exploring its unique ecosystem. Recent statistics reveal a significant uptick in tourism, with 216,143 visitors, including 2,143 international guests, in the fiscal year 2022-2023, generating Tk 3.94 crore in revenue for the government. This marks a notable increase from previous years, highlighting the forest's growing appeal and importance to Bangladesh's economy.\\n\\nAccording to data collected from the local forest office, the number of tourists was 1,89,570 in the fiscal year 2018-2019 and of them, 2,261 came from other countries.

A total of Tk 1.87 crore was collected as revenue during this period.\",\n          \"July 04, 2023 12:09 pm | Updated 12:10 pm IST - CUDDALORE\\n\\nThe Tamil Nadu Forest Department has drawn up a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of coastal habitats by creating bio-shields, and restoring degraded mangroves in Cuddalore district. The Department has planned to restore degraded areas in Pichavaram, and increase mangrove cover in the region by 100 hectares for the year 2023-24.\\n\\nThe Pichavaram mangroves are among the most productive ecosystems in the State, and are a storehouse of biodiversity, supporting 840 species of flora and fauna. These includes 115 species of birds, 16 species of mammals, 11 amphibians, 177 species of finfish, 95 species of zooplanktons, 82 phytoplanktons, 35 species of butterflies, 17 snakes and 3 species of seagrass.\\n\\nHowever, the mangroves are under serious threat of degradation due to various factors. Realising this, the Forest Department has planned the restoration of about 350 hectares of degraded patches in Pichavaram over the next three years.\\n\\nOfficial sources said the scheme for rehabilitation of coastal habitats and creation of bio-shields is being implemented in all coastal districts, and a major portion of the work would be taken up in Killai and Pichavaram under the Green Tamil Nadu Mission.\\n\\nThe micro plan has been approved by the District Green Committee/Wetlands Committee headed by Collector A. Arun Thamburaj and sent to the State Government. New mangrove plantations will be taken up in the Uppanar River in Kudikadu village on an expanse of 25 hectares in two locations during 2023-24.\\n\\nAccording to government estimates, the mangrove cover in Tamil Nadu is 44.94 square kilometres (sq km), out of which 7.73 sq km fall in Cuddalore. Straddling the Vellar and Coleroon estuaries, about 21% of Pichavaram is occupied by waterbodies, 27% by healthy mangrove vegetation, 38% by mudflats with sparsely grown mangroves, and the rest of the area is sand dunes.\\n\\nAccording to Villupuram District Forest Officer (DFO) Sumesh Soman who holds additional charge of Cuddalore district, \\u201cAs many as 13 species of mangroves are found in Pichavaram. Of these, there are only a few individuals of species like Lumnitzera racemosa and Rhizophora annamalayana. The degradation of mangroves usually occurs as a result of high soil salinity due to irregular flushing and low tidal amplitude. The Department has planned to regenerate these two species by using scientific methods such as the canal bank planting by modified fishbone design.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Soman added, \\u201cThe fishbone model allows the water to reach every nook and corner of the field channels. This model has found success in earlier applications at Pichavaram. The Department has also planned linear planting in riverine or estuary areas where the inter-tidal area is very low, but is flushed by tidal water regularly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe have also planned the linear planting of mangroves on a 20 km stretch of the coastline from 2024 to 2026. This will be carried out for two years with a 10 km stretch each year. The planting will be taken up from Muzhukkuthurai to Mudasalodai, MGR Thittu to Chinnavaikkal and Boat House to Chinnavaikkal,\\u201d the DFO said.\\n\\nThe Department has also planned the development of a bio-shield by planting non-mangrove species such as casuarina and palmyra on 10 hectares in the current year, to protect the coast from extreme weather events such as cyclones, floods and rise in sea levels.\",\n          \"KARACHI: While the overall cover of mangroves in the Indus delta has increased over the years, Karachi continues to lose these precious \\u201cprotected\\u201d forests on account of land allotment by the Board of Revenue and the Karachi Port Trust.\\n\\nThis was shared during a briefing organised on Wednesday on the conservation of mangrove forests and their future outlook at the WWF Wetland Centre for visiting members of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change.\\n\\nLed by the committee\\u2019s chairperson Senator Seemee Ezdi, the team included Senator Dr Mohammad Hamayun Mohmand, Senator Khalida Ateeb and Senator Abida Muhammad Azeem.\\n\\nWWF Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan briefed the committee on the climate vulnerability of Pakistan and highlighted the importance of the Indus delta region and mangroves conservation.\\n\\nForest official says Indus delta mangrove cover has increased to 240,000 hectares this year\\n\\nHe shared that ecologically, mangrove forests were the top habitat for biodiversity as they created a defence system against natural disasters such as tsunami, cyclones and sea storms.\\n\\nIn his presentation, the chief conservator of the forest department, Riaz Ahmed Wagan, discussed the role of his department in the conservation of mangroves and its future outlook, including environmental and economic benefits.\\n\\nAccording to him, the mangrove cover in the Indus delta has increased from 160,000 hectares in 2010 to 240,000 hectares this year on account of the conservation, plantation and rehabilitation efforts by the forest department, World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan and International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\n\\n\\u201cUnfortunately, however, the mangroves surrounding Karachi have shrunk from 2,000 hectares in 2010 to 1,800 hectares today mainly due to land allotment,\\u201d he said, regretting that destruction of mangroves continued despite their protected status and action by the forest department against offenders.\\n\\nThe areas of the Indus delta, he pointed out, had increased due to sea intrusion from 600,000 hectares in 2010 to 667,000 hectares today.\\n\\nAbout future plans, he said the department aimed to increase the total mangrove area to 500,000 hectares in coming years.\\n\\nSenior Manager Conservation WWF Sindh Altaaf Sheikh provided the committee with a detailed overview of WWF programmes in Pakistan.\\n\\nSharing details on the mangroves conservation approach, he said that WWF Pakistan was currently working on 18 different landscapes, from mountains to mangroves.\\n\\nThe Indus delta, he told the meeting, was the fifth largest arid ecosystem and hosted the seventh largest mangrove forest in the world.\\n\\nHe described the socioeconomic aspects of the Indus delta and said that the delta contributed 98 per cent of shrimp catch and more than 77pc of marine fish catch.\\n\\nHe also spoke on the challenges of the shrinkage of the Indus delta region due to sea intrusion and soil erosion. He noted that clearing of mangrove forest land for its commercial use had worsened deforestation, leading to loss of biodiversity.\\n\\nSpeaking to the media, the visiting senators emphasised the importance of introducing and sustaining both short- and long-term nature-based solutions to encourage mangrove conservation efforts and measures that were globally known to sustain and empower such programmes for a greener future.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 12th, 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Waves lash the side of the boat, and wind whips Erika Barnett\\u2019s straight black hair across her face as she watches dozens of herons, seagulls and small coastal birds bask in the shallow waters just off the shore.\\n\\nBeyond them stretches a dense mass of green leaves \\u2014 part of a huge mangrove estuary on Tiburon Island. It\\u2019s one of about a dozen interconnected stands in the Infiernillo Channel.

After propagating the plants, her family took them to the El Paraiso estuary nearby.\\n\\nThe conservation team\\u2019s current project is much the same \\u2014 collecting, propagating and reforesting the plants \\u2014 but on a larger scale. This year, they collected more than 6,000 plants from the channel.\\n\\nSo far, they are only propagating red mangroves, though black and white species also grow here.\\n\\n\\u201cThe three types are all important because, you know, they are companions,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEventually we will reforest all of them.\\u201d\\n\\nBut they\\u2019re starting with red mangroves, she said, because they are the easiest to propagate.\\n\\nKendal Blust/KJZZ Thousands of mangrove propagules grow in the Comcaac conservation group's small greenhouse.\\n\\nExtremes\\n\\n\\u201cClimate change is one of the biggest factors impacting the mangrove forests,\\u201d Barnett said.\\n\\nIncreased heat, drought and rising sea levels are all taking a toll on the plants.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is the extreme of extremes, my goodness,\\u201d said ecologist Laura Smith Monti, with the Arizona-based Borderlands Restoration Network and The University of Arizona. \\u201cThe mangroves stands in the Infiernillo Channel are the northernmost mangroves that occur on the West coast for sure.\\u201d\\n\\nMangroves here push the bounds of heat and drought the plants can withstand. Climate change will test those limits even further.\\n\\nBut this interconnected system of mangroves provides critical habitat; sequesters large quantities of carbon dioxide and protects coasts from erosion. And so far, the stands in the Infiernillo Channel are relatively healthy, likely because the protection afforded by the Comcaac community, Monti said.\\n\\nThe Comcaac have relied on these mangroves for thousands of years \\u2014 using them as a source of food, medicine and building materials. The dense forests even provided refuge for their ancestors who hid in mangroves to avoid being killed or captured by Spanish colonizers.\\n\\nBut the work to preserve and protect the plants takes time and money, and Monti wants the community to benefit from its conservation work.\\n\\n\\u201cThey should be paid for taking care of this little place on earth that is so important,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI see it as a way to generate conservation jobs into the future, and for young people to see it as a viable employment option.\\u201d\\n\\nThat isn\\u2019t an easy feat.

She hopes it will help with strong currents and fluctuating tides in the Infiernillo Channel that have washed away smaller reforested plants.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s something relatively new,\\u201d said Milka Valenzuela, who has been running the mangrove reforestation project at the El Soldado estuary near the beach town of San Carlos since 2017.\\n\\nKendal Blust/KJZZ Red mangrove propagules grow in Coke-bottle-pots in a small greenhouse outside Erika Barnett's home in Punta Chueca, Sonora.\\n\\nReforestation is challenging.

              "['To the Editor — Lee and colleagues1 compellingly suggest that restoring mangrove cover by using the widely practiced planting of mangroves, particularly monogeneric stands of Rhizophora (stilted mangroves), is not the solution to mangrove loss. They suggest that mangrove recovery must include protection of the remaining habitat and restoration of the degraded habitat, particularly in mangrove lands converted for shrimp aquaculture and agriculture. However, for mangrove recovery to be achieved, the drivers of inappropriate and ineffective mangrove planting programs must explicitly be considered.\\n\\nInappropriate mangrove planting programs often occur when project managers respond to inappropriate performance metrics imposed by external funding agencies, with short time frames for delivery. This process precludes both attention to the underlying drivers of mangrove deforestation, which often relate to inequality and land tenure2, and the development of participatory community restoration of degraded mangroves3. Because of their inability to resolve land-use and land-tenure issues, these ambitious, short-term mangrove restoration projects often plant mangroves on lands that are not owned by anyone. Such lands are frequently low in the intertidal frame and are therefore unsuitable for mangrove growth, thus ultimately leading to the failure described by Lee and colleagues.\\n\\nWe suggest that improving mangrove restoration requires investment in a range of measures to address the underlying factors leading to mangrove deforestation and degradation. These issues are complex and time consuming to resolve, and include realignment of government policy, negotiations over land tenure, and consideration of compensation and alternate livelihoods. For example, where law enforcement is weak, and government policy supports aquaculture production and export for foreign cash earnings, those with the capital to conduct aquaculture will acquire and clear mangroves regardless of formal land use designations. Restoration of these lands would require changes in government policy; negotiation with aquaculture landholders, who typically do not live in the local community and have little incentive to restore the land; and engagement with the local community, whose members are often unwilling and unable to challenge the landholders, and may doubt that restoration will benefit them. Working with wealthy and illegal landowners may run against the mandate of many institutions that finance mangrove restoration, such as development banks, aid agencies and international foundations. However, unless innovative approaches are developed to address the land-tenure bottleneck, mangroves will continue to be planted inappropriately on uncontested land and will remain degraded.\\n\\nIt is equally important to address this issue from a multi-disciplinary perspective with new research into social, economic and policy factors alongside biophysical considerations4. Mangrove restoration opportunity will hinge on mediation by informed facilitators who are versed in forest conflict resolution. Heavy-handed solutions that prioritize enforcement to enable mangrove restoration—such as forceful eviction of land users—are likely to perpetuate or exacerbate conflict or result in mangrove clearing in other areas (known as leakage).',\n",
              " \"The present study makes an attempt to prioritize restoration target areas by using mangrove habitat suitability models, niche overlay function, and mangrove degradation rate using a grid-based approach over the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. Degraded mangrove areas between 1975 and 2020 were identified using Landsat images and field verification of the specific sites. The SBR was divided into 5609 grids using a 1 km grid to understand the nature of mangrove degradation and modeling purpose (Fig. 3). Landsat MSS (1975) and Landsat 8 OLI (2020) satellite data were utilized for preparing a land use/landcover map of the SBR using a supervised classification technique. The classification accuracy was assessed through the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient. Overall accuracy was found 87.62% for 1975 and 94.9% for 2020 and the kappa coefficient values was 0.89 for 1975 and 0.96 for 2020. Post classification change matrix technique was used to prepare land use/land cover change map during 1975 and 2020. The area under vegetation cover and mangrove was extracted from the land use land cover map. NDVI maps during different seasons were utilized to improve the accuracy of the vegetation cover map of the SBR. Ten influencing drivers were selected for analyzing the habitat suitability of mangrove forests (Table 1). The details of the methodological framework are presented in Fig. 2.\\n\\nTable 1 Major drivers of mangrove degradation in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. Full size table\\n\\nFigure 2 Methodological framework of the study. Full size image\\n\\nOccurrence data\\n\\nWe selected 18 dominant mangrove species in Indian Sundarban for preparing a habitat suitability model (Table 2). The occurrence data of the selected mangrove species have been collected from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the existing published literature68,69. The occurrence data were collected from the published sources70,71,72,73,74 and field survey using a grid-based stratified random sampling approach during 2018–2019. We received help from the local fisherman, crab and honey collector to identify mangrove species and collected samples from the core forest areas. The total grids were divided into 19 strata as per the administrative blocks for an easy process and 50 samples were selected from each stratum. In this way, a total of 950 occurrence locations were selected from the field survey (Fig. 3). The secondary occurrence data was verified through google earth images to avoid duplication. Further, the occurrence data was run through a statistical assessment using spatially rarefied in ArcGIS SDM toolbox by selecting a single point grid cell for individual species (1 km grid). Finally, we selected a total of 1560 occurrence data (707 from the archive sources and 853 from the field survey (Table 2) to develop species distribution models.\\n\\nTable 2 Details of the selected mangrove species and the occurrence data. Full size table\\n\\nFigure 3 A grid-based field survey (2018–2019) has been conducted to collect the species occurrence data of 18 mangrove species. (The satellite images are obtained from the ArcGIS google earth base map. The species occurrence locations were collected through Garmin eTrex 32 × Outdoor Handheld GPS and the maps were prepared using ArcGIS 10.8.2 software [https://desktop.arcgis.com].) Full size image\\n\\nData preparation and variable selection\\n\\nAfter a detailed literature review and field knowledge, we considered 36 variables from 6 different parameters for the present study. The data source, data structure, spatial resolution, and references of the data have been provided in Appendix 1. All the raster variables were re-sampled into 1 km resolution using resample tool in ArcGIS to match the original resolution of WorldClim data and the 1 km sampling grid76. All 30-m raster images were reclassified into 1 km grid cell and the average number of pixels over 5609 girds in Sundarban were determined to be 33,334. From the topographical parameters, we selected six important variables (Appendix 2A) namely, elevation, slope, curvature, geomorphology, topographic wetness index (TWI), and stream power index (SPI) (Appendix 1). All the selected topographical variables were intricately linked with the tidal inundation and temperature, which can directly influence the distribution of mangrove species77. From environmental parameters, 6 variables (Appendix 2B) were selected namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), level of flood inundation, mean tidal range, storm surge height, normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and rate of erosion/accretion (Appendix 1). Mangroves are known as salt-tolerant higher groups of coastal plants78 which are mainly flourish in the backwater, estuaries, creeks, and lagoons. These flowering plants are inundated and exposed two times a day during high tide and low tide with coastal marine water and grow up by the mixture of the freshwater flow from upstream. Thus, water is a very important parameter for assessing mangrove habitat suitability. Six variables were selected as underwater parameters namely water surface temperature, water salinity, PH value, distance from water, drainage density, and modified normalized difference water index (Appendix 2C). All these variables are directly associated with the growth and distribution of mangrove species in Sundarban (Appendix 1). Soil is considered an influencing parameter along with climate for the distribution of flora at spatial scales1,79. However, few studies have considered soil variables in modeling mangrove distribution52. Six important variables namely soil texture, soil salinity index, soil fertility index, sediment yield factor (Ton), electronic conductivity (EC), and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI) were selected to examine the influence of soil (Appendix 2D).\\n\\nBioclimatic layers are one of the popular variables widely used by various scholars in order to build species distribution and ecological niche modeling80. Many researchers have also used the bioclimatic variables for mangrove habitat suitability models because of their association with climate-related phenomena, especially temperature and precipitation81. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to remove the data redundancy and avoid the random error and uncertainty of the model (Appendix 3). Of the 19 variables only the most suitable 6 bioclimatic variable layers were used for this study: BIO1, Annual Mean Temperature; BIO2, Mean Diurnal Range; BIO3, Isothermality; BIO4, Temperature Seasonality, BIO12 = Annual Precipitation and BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Appendix 2E) Anthropogenic activities are the main factors for the decrease in areas under mangroves globally82, Sundarban is no exception to this encroachment. Six disturbance variables namely distance from the road, road density, distance from Settlement, population density, distance from agriculture field, and embankment density were selected for habitat suitability analysis based on local knowledge (Appendix 2F).\\n\\nVariable performance for habitat suitability model\\n\\nModel collinearity among the variables was checked to avoid the negative influence of variables on the performance of the model. The predictive ability of all individual variables was tested before performing the suitability model83. The linear support vector machine (LSVM) model was utilized for assessing the prediction capacity of variables. LSVM can be expressed as:\\n\\n$$g(x)=Sgn({w}^{T}a+b)$$\\n\\nwhere, \\\\({w}^{T}\\\\) is the weight matrix of the habitat suitability variables, \\\\(a=\\\\) (a 1 , a 2 …a 14 ) vector inputs of the variables, \\\\(b\\\\) is the offset from the origin of the hyper-plane. The variables ith with the weight \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\) close to 0 has a smaller effect on the prediction than the one with larger values of \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\). The average merit (AM) for each variable and its ability for prediction ranged between 1 and 10 (Table 3). The values > 5 represent the potential influencing variables for habitat suitability model.\\n\\nTable 3 Intrinsic and extrinsic model evaluation scores for each species. Full size table\\n\\nModel development and validation\\n\\nThe habitat suitability models for 18 selected mangrove species were constructed using ten algorithms through the biomod2 package in R studio. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models can be set up in the R studio package for getting different complex conditions and properties which can give a possible higher accuracy on the species distribution model84. For the present study, we performed 10-machine learning algorithms: (1) MAXENT: Maximum Entropy; (2) GLM: Generalized Linear Model; (3) MARS: Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines; (4) GAM: Generalized Additive Model; (5) RF: Random Forest; (6) GBM: Boosted Regression Trees model; (7) CTA: Classification Tree Analysis, (8) ANN: Artificial Neural Network; (9) FDA: Flexible Discriminant Analysis and (10) SRE: Surface Range Envelop model. The performance of all ten models has been assessed through the intrinsic model building process and extrinsic validation methods. For this, we have split the occurrence data into 80% for training and 20% for testing the model. For creating the intrinsic model, we randomly used 75% of the occurrence data for training the model and the remaining 25% for testing each individual model. The modeling process was run for 18 different species using 10 machine learning algorithms. In this way, 180 models were run. Cohen's Kappa (KAPPA), true skill statistic (TSS), and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) models were used for validated all the individual models.\\n\\nFinally, for the extrinsic evaluation, the algorithms which have > 0.75 predicting performance for all the validation models (KAPPA, TSS, and ROC) were used to build the final ensemble model (Appendix 4). We have used the ensemble forecast method using a weighted mean approach in biomod2 packages within R studio for producing the final habitat suitability models for all the selected species. The final habitat suitability models for all 18 species were again validated through the Boyce index (BI) using the 20% data which were kept aside for validation85 (Table 3). The output habitat suitability raster index from the ensemble models for all species was then categorized into four classes namely highly suitable, moderately suitable, slightly suitable, and not suitable.\\n\\nNiche overlap analysis and setting restoration prioritization\\n\\nModified Hellinger metric (I) and Schoener's index of niche breadth (D) were used to estimate the niche overlap among 18 species. The spatial similarity and dissimilarity of niche area for the selected species has been calculate using the raster calculator spatial overlay function in ArcGIS.\\n\\nWe have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to prepare a restoration priority rank for all 18 species based on their niche characteristics, estimated potential distribution, local knowledge, and degradation status.\\n\\nIdentification of restoration prioritize grids\\n\\nPercentage of niche overlap data, restoration priority rank for all species, habitat suitability maps for all individual species, percentage of mangrove cover, mangrove degradation rate, mangrove accretion rate, and human disturbance rate were used as input functions for identifying the restoration prioritized grids over 5609 girds in Sundarban. Grid-wise total mangrove area for the present scenario was calculated from the land use/land cover map for 2020. A grid-wise mangrove degradation rate and mangrove accretion rate have been calculated using the land use land cover change between 1975 and 2020. The human disturbance rate was calculated using the following equation:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{HDR}=\\\\frac{(BR+NP+RD+AR)}{1km}*100$$\\n\\nwhere HDR is the human disturbance rate, BR is the percentage of built-up area in each grid, NP is the number of populations in each grid, RD = road density in each grid and AR is the percentage of agricultural area in each grid.\\n\\nFor the preparation of final restoration prioritize grids we developed a species-wise grid-based algorithm using the FactomineR package in R studio. The final output of the species level restoration prioritize grids were assessed by using negative and positive indicators function. The negative indicators included: (1) > 80% present mangrove cover grid in 2020, (2) HDR value more than > 75%, (3) not suitable and slightly suitable grids, (4) natural accretion rate as > 75%. The positive indicators for this algorithm involved: (1) restoration priority rank for each individual species, (2) niche overlap grid for each individual species (P < 0.05), (3) highly and moderately suitability grids for each individual species, (4) degradation date > 75%.\",\n",
              " 'Mangrove cover change variables. We used the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) v2.0 dataset from 1996 to 201656 to calculate four response variables across landscape mangrove geomorphic units24 over two time periods, 1996–2007 and 2007–2016: (1) percent net loss (units that had a net change in mangrove cover of <0, converted to a positive number), (2) percent net gain (units that had a net change in mangrove cover of >0), (3) percent gross loss (units that had a decrease in mangrove cover, not accounting for any increase), and (4) percent gross gain (units that had an increase in mangrove cover, not accounting for any decrease). Percent variables were calculated relative to the area at the start of the time period and were log transformed to meet the assumptions of the statistical models. We initially also considered 5 primary response variables (Supplementary Table 3), including net change in mangrove area ranging from negative (loss) to zero (no change) to positive (gain), however, the data did not meet model assumptions of equal variance (Supplementary Table 9). It was therefore necessary to separate areas of net loss and net gain and areas of gross loss and gross gain to remove zeros and log-transform to achieve normal distribution. Area of mangrove change was correlated with size of the mangrove geomorphic unit (higher area of mangrove loss or gain in bigger units), therefore we included geomorphic unit size as an explanatory variable in the models with primary response variables. We selected the transformations of these primary variables - percent net loss, percent net gain, percent gross loss, and percent gross gain to include in the analysis, because the percent changes control for differences in relative sizes of geomorphic units and because net change alone can underestimate the extent of change57.\\n\\nExamining mangrove change across geomorphic settings is likely to be relevant to socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Mangroves occur in the intertidal zone in diverse coastal geomorphic settings (e.g., deltas, estuaries, lagoons) shaped by rivers, tides, and waves58,59. The distribution, structure, and productivity of mangroves varies spatially with regional climate and local geomorphological processes (e.g., river discharge, tidal range, hydroperiod, and wave activity) that control soil biogeochemistry60,61,62,63. These geomorphic settings are defined by natural landscape boundaries (e.g., catchments/bays) which also often delineate boundaries of human settlements. A global mangrove biophysical typology v2.2 dataset64 was used for the delineation of landscape mangrove geomorphic units, which used a composite of the GMW dataset from the 1996, 2007, 2010, and 2016 timesteps to classify the maximal extent of mangrove cover into 4394 units (classified as delta, estuarine, lagoon or open coast). The mangrove geomorphic units do not include non-mangrove patches, unless they have been lost from the unit over time. The mean size of geomorphic units was 33.63 ha. Some splits of geomorphic units were undertaken to reduce size and divide by country boundaries. The four largest deltas (northern Brazil Delta ID 70000, Sundarbans Delta ID 70004, Niger Delta ID 70009, and Papua coast Delta ID 70013) were split into 4, 5, 4, and 2 units, respectively to aid with data processing. Mangrove geomorphic units that overlapped two countries (Peru/Ecuador, Singapore/Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea/Australia) were split by the national boundary.\\n\\nThe country governing each geomorphic unit was assigned to match national-level variables to geomorphic units. To capture mangroves that are mapped outside of country coastline boundaries, we did a union of the GADM country shapefile v3.665 and the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) v1166. The following manual country designations were made to resolve overlapping claims in the EEZs: (1) Hong Kong was merged with China as Hong Kong does not have a mapped EEZ; (2) The overlapping claim of Sudan/Egypt was maintained as a joint Sudan/Egypt designation, as this is an area of disputed land called the Halayib Triangle. However, for this study, mangrove units within this area were assigned to Egypt because Egypt currently has military control over the area; (3) Mayotte (claimed by France and Comoros) was assigned to Mayotte as it is a separate overseas territory of France recognised in GADM that has different socioeconomic variables; (4) The protected zone established under the Torres Strait Treaty was assigned to Australia as these islands are Australian territory.\\n\\nAreas of mangrove cover in 1996, 2007, and 2016, and gross losses and gains in each geomorphic units over the two time periods were assessed in ArcMap 10.867. Percent losses and gains were calculated in R 4.0.268. In using the GMW mapping, a minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended for reliable results5, therefore we removed all geomorphic units less than 1 ha from the analysis, which reduced the available sample size from 4394 across 108 countries to 4235 units across 108 countries. In calculating percent net gains, 11 and 12 of the units returned infinity values for 1996–2007 and 2007–2016, respectively, because there was no initial mangrove cover. In these instances, 100% gain was assigned to these units.\\n\\nSocioeconomic variables (Supplementary Table 4)\\n\\nEconomic growth\\n\\nPrevious global analyses of mangroves have been limited by data availability on economic activity to national metrics, such as a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)12,18. Night-time lights satellite data provide local measures of economic activity that are comparable through time and available globally9,69. The data improve estimates of GDP in low to middle income countries69 and are strongly correlated with local indicators of human development70 and electricity consumption and GDP at the national-level71. We used the Night-time Lights Time Series v472 stable lights data, where transient lights that are deemed ephemeral, e.g., fires, have been filtered out and non-lit areas set to zero73, choosing the newer satellites where applicable70. As a proxy for local economic growth, we calculated the change in annual average stable lights within a 100 km buffer of the centroid of each geomorphic unit from 1996 to 2007 and 2007 to 2013 (no data available past 2013) using the ‘raster’ package in R74. The 100 km buffer was chosen to account for pressures from human activity within and surrounding the mangrove area, and to avoid bias with larger spatial units70.\\n\\nMarket accessibility\\n\\nTravel time to the nearest major market (national or provincial capital, landmark city, or major population centre) has been shown to be a stronger predictor of fish biomass on coral reefs than population density or linear distance to markets27. We used the global map of travel time to cities for 201575 to estimate the average travel time from each geomorphic unit to the nearest city via surface transport using the ‘raster’ package in R74, as an indicator of access to markets to trade commodities (e.g., rice, shrimp, palm oil).\\n\\nEconomic complexity\\n\\nPrevious studies have examined the effect of GDP on mangrove change18, however, this is a blunt measure of country capability. Measuring a country’s economic complexity, that is the diversified capability of a nation’s economy, is preferable. For example, a country with high GDP but low economic complexity can be prone to regulatory capture by high-value natural resource industries and resource corruption26. Therefore, we used the Economic Complexity Index (ECI)76 for countries as an indicator of regulatory independence. The ECI had better coverage of countries in later years (Supplementary Table 4), therefore the ECI for the end of the time periods was used (2007 and 2016), although we recognise this may reduce the detection of trends because of potential time lags in impacts.\\n\\nDemocracy\\n\\nWe used the Varieties of Democracy (VDEM) index v10 which measures a country’s degree of freedom of association, clean elections, freedom of expression, elected executives, and suffrage77, and has been indicated to influence NDC ambition in countries to address climate change78. We adopted the VDEM index for the start of the time periods (1996 and 2007) to account for potential time lags in impacts.\\n\\nCommunity forestry support\\n\\nWe determined the extent that community forestry (CF) is implemented across countries through a systematic review of articles returned in the Web of Science database (Core collection; Thomson Reuters, New York, U.S.A.). We used the search terms: TS = (“community forestry” OR “community-based forestry” OR “social forestry”) AND (TI = ”country” OR AB = ”country”) to identify how many CF case studies were reported in each country, and whether any were in mangroves. As scientific literature is biased towards particular regions, we also reviewed relevant FAO global studies79,80,81 and online databases (ICCA registry82 and REDD projects database83) to identify additional case studies (Supplementary Fig. 5). We then generated scores of 0–3 for each country based on summing values assessed using these criteria: +1 (1–50 CF case studies); +2 (>50 CF case studies); +1 (CF case study in mangroves). There may have been some double counting as we counted the number of case studies in each article, and we will have missed CF projects not published or communicated in English. However, this is likely to have had a limited impact on the scoring method.\\n\\nIndigenous land\\n\\nThe proportion of Indigenous peoples’ land versus other land per country was calculated from national-level data84. Whilst this study involved Indigenous peoples’ land mapping at a global scale, the spatial data was not published, and thus we could only evaluate the influence of Indigenous land at the national level rather than local level.\\n\\nRestoration effort\\n\\nThe number of mangrove restoration sites per country was calculated from combining two datasets collated by C. Lovelock (2020) and Y.M. Gatt and T.A. Worthington (2020) identifying mangrove restoration project locations from web searches in English and for scientific and grey literature using Google Scholar. Duplications were removed and the number of sites was used as an indicator of effort. This will underrepresent effort in countries with few, large sites, and where restoration projects are not published or communicated in English.\\n\\nClimate commitments\\n\\nThe Paris Agreement is a global programme for countries to commit to climate action by submitting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework for the Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC). First, we reviewed NDCs for mangrove-holding nations from the NDC Registry85 submitted as of 07/01/2021 to determine the extent that mangroves or coastal ecosystems were included in national climate policy (scoring method in Supplementary Table 4). We hypothesised that countries with mangrove or coastal ecosystem NDCs may be more likely to promote mangrove conservation or restoration. While the first NDCs were submitted around 2015, at the end of our time series, we suspected higher commitments would point towards a stronger baseline in environmental governance. Most countries submitted updated or second NDCs during 2021 however these were not considered relevant to the time periods assessed. Google Translate was used to interpret NDCs in languages other than English.\\n\\nRamsar wetlands\\n\\nThe ecological character of Ramsar wetlands have been found to be significantly better than those of wetlands generally86. The area of Ramsar coastal and marine wetlands from the Ramsar Sites Information Service87 was calculated per country. Thirty-eight mangrove-holding countries are not signatories to the Ramsar Convention, and these countries were assigned a value of 0. The area of Ramsar wetlands per country was scaled by dividing by the country’s area of mangroves in 1996.\\n\\nEnvironmental governance\\n\\nWe assessed the Environmental Performance Index (EPI)88 as an indicator of a country’s effectiveness in environmental governance. The biodiversity and habitat (BDH) issue category assesses countries’ actions toward retaining natural ecosystems and protecting the full range of biodiversity within their borders. We took the BDH score for 2020 for the 2007–2016 time period and the BDH score for 2010 for the 1996–2007 time period (calculated by subtracting the ten-year change from BDH 2020). However, due to collinearity with other variables this index was excluded from the analysis (see statistical analysis).\\n\\nProtected area management\\n\\nWe also assessed Marine Protected Area (MPA) staff capacity as an indicator of the effectiveness of management of protected areas for countries. We used published global marine protected area (MPA) management data14 which is based on the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), the World Bank MPA Score Card, and the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Programme’s MPA Management Assessment Checklist. Adequate staff capacity was the most important factor in explaining fish responses to MPA management globally, followed by budget capacity, but they were significantly correlated14. We, therefore, calculated the mean staff capacity across MPAs per country as our indicator. Mangroves can be included in terrestrial protected areas, which are not represented in this dataset, however, this measure provides an indicator of national governance of protected areas. However, due to collinearity with other variables this indicator was excluded from the analysis (see statistical analysis). The extent of protected areas was not included in the analysis because it has already been found to influence mangrove loss18.\\n\\nBiophysical variables (Supplementary Table 5)\\n\\nCoastal geomorphic type\\n\\nMangrove extent change likely varies among different coastal geomorphic settings because human activities or environmental changes occur more commonly in some geomorphic settings than others. For example, losses of lagoonal mangroves were nearly twice as large as those in other geomorphic types24. Landscape geomorphic units from the global mangrove typology dataset v2.264 were classified as delta, estuary, lagoon or open coast.\\n\\nSediment availability\\n\\nMangrove expansion and retreat are driven by sediment deposition and erosion, which are influenced by sediment availability from rivers and wave action, and alterations in hydrodynamic regimes47,89. We used the sediment trapping index from the global free-flowing rivers (FFR) dataset90 to indicate sediment availability from rivers within different geomorphic units. A mangrove catchment dataset was created based on the HydroSHEDS database91. River networks that intersected with mangrove geomorphic units were linked to that unit’s ID. Where rivers intersected multiple units, they were manually assigned by visual inspection. River basins that intersected either with the geomorphic units directly or the river networks were also linked to that unit’s ID. The FFR dataset90 was then spatially joined to the mangrove catchment dataset to identify the most downstream (i.e., the coastal outlet) segment of each FFR and its associated sediment trapping index. Not all geomorphic units (n = 3475) were linked to an FFR, however, an individual unit could be linked with several FFRs. Therefore, the unit sediment trapping index was the weighted mean of the river values, with weighting based on each FFR’s average long-term (1971–2000) naturalised discharge (m3s−1), with discharge set to the minimum value for segments with zero flow. Geomorphic units without connecting FFRs were given an index of zero (no sediment trapping). The sediment trapping index represents the percentage of the potential sediment load trapped by anthropogenic barriers along the river section. The focus on river barriers may obscure larger scale oceanic patterns that influence mangrove losses and gains (e.g., movement of mud banks from the Amazon River over 1000’s of kilometres92) or increases in sediment that could be coming from soils with catchment deforestation and erosion.\\n\\nHabitat fragmentation\\n\\nMany countries with high mangrove loss have been associated with elevated fragmentation of mangrove forests, although the relationship is not consistent at the global scale93. We calculated the clumpiness index of mangrove patches within geomorphic units within each time period, as this habitat fragmentation metric is independent of areal extent93. Whilst habitat fragmentation can be human-driven, clumpiness measures the patchy distribution of mangroves, which can also be due to natural factors inducing edge effects. We used a similar approach to Bryan-Brown, et al.86 to quantify the clumpiness index. The ‘landscape’ was defined as the combined extent of the mangrove geomorphic units across four timesteps (1996, 2007, 2010, and 2016) from the GMW dataset56. For the three focal years in this study (1996, 2007, and 2016) each geomorphic unit (n = 4394) was converted into a two-class polygon, where class one represented mangroves present during that time step and class two mangroves present in the other time steps (i.e., areas of mangrove loss). The polygons were transformed to a projected coordinate system (World Cylindrical Equal Area) and converted to rasters with a resolution of 25 m. Each raster was imported into R version 3.6.394, with clumpiness calculated using the package ‘landscapemetrics’ v1.5.095.\\n\\nClumpiness describes how patches are dispersed across the landscape and ranges between minus one, where patches are maximally disaggregated, to one, where patches are maximally aggregated, a value of zero represents a case whereby patches are randomly distributed across the landscape. The clumpiness index requires that both classes are present in the landscape, therefore a no data value (NA) was returned for units where no loss of mangroves had occurred, or where there was 100% gain of mangroves in a later time period. The number of directions in which patches were connected was set to eight. The following manual fixes were conducted for NA values returned: 1) Where NA was returned for units where no loss of mangroves had occurred in another time period, i.e., class 1 (mangrove present) = 1 and class 2 (mangrove loss) = 0, assume +1 (maximally clumped); and 2) Where NA was returned for units where there was 100% gain of mangroves in a later time period, i.e., class 1 (mangrove present) = 0, class 2 (mangrove present) = 1 (100% gain), assume −1 (maximally disaggregated).\\n\\nTidal amplitude\\n\\nIn settings of low tidal range, mangrove vertical accretion is less likely to keep pace with rapid sea level rise3. However, in settings of high tidal range, mangroves may be more extensive and vulnerable to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture because of larger tidal flat extents. The Finite Element Solution global tide model (FES2014)96 is considered one of the most accurate tide models for shallow coastal areas97 and was selected to estimate the mean tidal amplitude within each geomorphic unit using the principal lunar semi-diurnal or M 2 tidal amplitude as this is this most dominant tidal constituent98. To account for potential variation in the tidal amplitude across large geomorphic units, the raster pixel value for M 2 tidal amplitude96 closest to the centroid of each mangrove patch within each unit was calculated, with the smallest value set at 0.01 m. For each geomorphic unit, the tidal amplitude was calculated as the weighted mean of the patch values, with weighting based on the patch area relative to the total unit area.\\n\\nAntecedent sea-level rise\\n\\nThe distribution of mangroves on shorelines changes over time with sediment accretion, erosion, subsidence, and sea-level rise (SLR)99, and periods of low sea level can cause mangrove dieback100. We used regional mean sea-level trends between January 1993 and December 2015 from the global sea level Essential Climate Variable (ECV) product v.2101,102 to estimate the mean antecedent SLR for each geomorphic unit. Spatial variation in regional sea-level trends generally range between −5 and +5 mm yr−1 (global mean of 3 mm yr−1)13. Extreme values (>5 mm yr−1) observed in the dataset are subject to high levels of uncertainty (Sea Level CCI team, pers. comm.), and were therefore truncated to 5 mm yr−1. The raster pixel value for SLR102 closest to the centroid of each mangrove patch within each geomorphic unit was calculated. The geomorphic unit antecedent SLR values was calculated as the weighted mean of the patch values within the unit.\\n\\nDrought\\n\\nWhilst long-term precipitation and temperature influence mangrove distribution globally62, periods of low rainfall have been reported to cause extensive mangrove dieback at regional scales, particularly when combined with high temperatures and low sea levels103. We used the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from the global SPEI database v.2.6104 as an index of drought severity. SPEI is derived from precipitation and temperature and is considered an improved drought index that allows spatial and temporal comparability105,106. The mean SPEI raster pixel value was calculated for each time period and then averaged across the geomorphic units using the ‘ncdf4’107 and ‘raster’ packages74 in R.\\n\\nTropical storm frequency\\n\\nLarge-scale destruction of mangroves across regions have been reported from strong winds, high energy waves, and storm surges associated with tropical storms108. We used the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) dataset since 1980 v4109 to calculate the number of tropical cyclone occurrences (points along their paths) within a 200 km buffer of the centroid of geomorphic units within each time period using the sf package110 in R. Maximum wind velocity and surface pressures are likely experienced within 100 km of a cyclone’s eye111, therefore the 200 km buffer zone was selected to cover the average size of geomorphic units (33.63 ha), and all tropical storms potentially influencing mangrove growth. Whilst tropical storms affect only 42% of the world’s mangroves60, they are likely to be important stressors within cyclone-impacted countries.\\n\\nMinimum temperature\\n\\nExtreme low temperature events were a driver of mangrove loss in subtropical regions, such as Florida and Louisianan of the US, and China28,112. We used the WorldClim bioclimatic variable 6 (minimum temperature of the coldest month averaged for the years 1970–2000)113 to calculate the mean minimum temperature across the geomorphic units using the ‘sf’110 and ‘raster’ packages74 in R. Where NAs were returned due to no overlapping raster layer, the value of the closest raster pixel to the centroid of the geomorphic unit was assigned.\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nWe used multi-level linear modelling to investigate relationships between mangrove cover change variables and socioeconomic and biophysical variables to consider landscape (level 1) and country (level 2) predictors in a hierarchical approach114. For each response variable, we modelled the response for 1996–2007 and 2007–2016, using explanatory variables specific to the time-period where available. Data inspection revealed that high percent loss or gain was concentrated in small geomorphic units, therefore to avoid bias in our results, we removed geomorphic units less than 100 ha from the analysis, which further reduced the available sample size to 3134 units across 95 countries. Statistical analysis was undertaken in R 4.0.268.\\n\\nThe response variables were log-transformed to fit normal distribution. We tested for collinearity between our explanatory variables using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r > 0.5) (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). MPA staff capacity and EPI were excluded from our models because MPA staff capacity was correlated with ECI 2007 and ECI 2016 (both r = 0.54), and EPI 2020 was correlated with VDEM 2016 (r = 0.63). To improve model fit, travel time to the nearest city, mangrove restoration effort and Ramsar wetland area (relative) were log+1-transformed, and tidal amplitude was log-transformed.\\n\\nTwo linear multi-level (mixed-effects) models were fitted for each response variable using the lme function in the ‘lme4’ package115 (Supplementary Table 8). First, a random intercept model with intercepts of landscape-level predictors varying by country was fitted. Then a random intercept and slope (coefficients) model with intercepts of landscape-level predictors varying by country, as well as slopes for socioeconomic predictors considered to have between-country variation (travel time to nearest city and night-time lights growth) was fitted, as we expect that mangrove cover change may respond to economic growth and market accessibility depending on national governance. A likelihood ratio test between the null linear model and the null random intercept model for each response variable showed that effects varied across countries and therefore we included country as a random effect (Supplementary Table 9). We also conducted likelihood ratio tests between the random intercept model and the random coefficient model to test whether the effect of travel time and night-time lights on mangrove change varies across countries. If significant, the model including random slopes for travel time and night-time lights was used (Supplementary Table 9). Mixed-effects models were fitted by maximum likelihood and model fit was validated by inspection of residual plots for the four response variables included in the analysis; percent net loss, percent net gain, percent gross loss, and percent gross gain (Supplementary Table 9).\\n\\nTo test for spatial autocorrelation we performed spatial autoregressive (SAR) models using the errorsarlm function in the ‘spatialreg’ package116. SAR models were first fitted using a range of neighbourhood distances (50, 500, and 1000 km in 100 km intervals) for the net change variable117. Distance of 500 km showed the smallest AIC and was therefore adopted for all response variables. Neighbourhood lists of the centroid coordinates of the geomorphic units were defined with the row-standardised (‘W’) coding using the ‘spdep’ package118. We then produced Moran’s I correlograms using the correlog function in the ‘ncf’ package119 and the centroid coordinates of the geomorphic units. Correlograms for the multi-level model and SAR model were compared for each response variable (Supplementary Fig. 4). The SAR models did not improve spatial autocorrelation for any of the mangrove cover change variables and therefore the multi-level models were adopted.\\n\\nHotspot estimates\\n\\nWe defined hotspots as geomorphic units where raw values of percent net and gross loss and gain between 2007 and 2016 (\\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)) differed by more than two standard deviations (sd) from the country average (\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)).\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\rm{More}}}}}}}\\\\,{{{{{{\\\\rm{loss}}}}}}}/{{{{{{\\\\rm{more}}}}}}}\\\\,{{{{{{\\\\rm{gain}}}}}}}=\\\\left(\\\\gamma -\\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\, > \\\\, (2\\\\,\\\\times {{{{{{\\\\rm{sd}}}}}}})$$ (1)\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\rm{Less}}}}}}}\\\\,{{{{{{\\\\rm{loss}}}}}}}\\\\,/\\\\,{{{{{{\\\\rm{less}}}}}}}\\\\,{{{{{{\\\\rm{gain}}}}}}}=\\\\left(\\\\gamma -\\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\, < \\\\, -(2\\\\,\\\\times {{{{{{\\\\rm{sd}}}}}}})$$ (2)\\n\\nWe excluded countries with only one geomorphic unit. Large deviations of the raw value from the country average were found for small units at a threshold below 50 km2, therefore we removed all units smaller than 50 km2 to overcome bias of hotspots towards smaller sites. This likely removed the identification of several hotspots. For example, Myanmar has had some large gains due to river sediments in the Gulf of Martaban (net gain of 100 % in Estuary 5834 and 39 % in Open Coast 62244), however, these areas were small (8 and 2 km2, respectively) and were therefore removed from the hotspot estimates.\\n\\nWe analysed the factors contributing to hotspots by spatial investigation of satellite imagery in Google Earth with mangrove specialists from those countries.

Parameters determining environmental stressors (e.g., T opt , T min , T max , VPD min , and VPD max ) were set based on the general characteristics of mangroves worldwide. It may not be as accurate for the mangroves in our study sites, but it generally reflects the response of mangroves to environmental changes. Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. S1, it is applicable to our study sites. Despite the specific characteristics of each mangrove ecosystem at different sites being preferred, this study first offers the possibility to estimate mangrove productivity at a larger scale to track GPP, thus emphasizing the role of mangrove ecosystems nationally or worldwide.\\n\\nThe validation results showed that the LUE values of the mangrove model agreed well with those estimated by EC method (Fig. 3) and indicated improved performance (slope = 0.8218–1.0108, intercept = -0.0006–0.0052, R2 = 0.54–0.64, RMSE = 0.0051–0.0068, Pearson’s r = 0.73–1), compared to the MOD17 model (slope = 0.4993–0.5566, intercept = 0.0311–0.0313, R2 = 0.24–0.45, RMSE = 0.0217–0.0220, Pearson’s r = 0.45–0.49). Firstly, the RS-based LUE model for terrestrial ecosystems (MOD17) considers only the environmental stressors of T air and VPD. The photosynthesis in mangrove forests is influenced by other unique environmental factors caused by tidal inundation. According to Fig. S3, PAR caused the most significant effect on LUE, which is consistent with previous studies14,30,32. The impact of SST has not been quantitatively assessed, however, SST is a critical control that determines the upper latitudinal range of mangrove ecosystems12,33. In our study, the effects of SST and salinity on the mangrove LUE were quantified and helped improve LUE modeling.\\n\\nSecondly, LUE max was typically defined for different land covers, however, there were no specific values for mangrove forests. In this study, the LUE max of mangroves was first determined. It is worth noting that daytime NEE responses to PAR vary depending on the T air 23,30,34 so that LUE max was determined separately at high, optimal, and low temperatures. The results showed that LUE max reached a maximum when T air was within the optimal range for mangroves, which represents the high productivity of mangrove ecosystems. Furthermore, the estimated LUE max of mangrove forests (0.057) was larger than most terrestrial forests35,36,37, which could contribute to the high production and carbon sequestration in mangrove forests.\\n\\nLastly, the relatively low stomatal conductance of mangroves leads to low LSP compared with terrestrial forests, which could result in the high-irradiance stress for photosynthesis38,39. Mangrove LSP ranges from about 0.2–1.2 mmol/m2/s, depending on the species and environments40,41,42. LUE was relatively low in April and May when seasonal PAR was high, as photosynthesis is more likely to reach saturation. Therefore, we assumed the LUE of mangroves decreased with increasing PAR. In addition, we found that the downscaling effect of PAR on LUE was not constant, but varied with increasing PAR. As follows, different PAR scalars were set for mangroves according to different PAR values. This is a first attempt at refining PAR scalar considering different solar radiation, which represents a significant departure from the assumption of a constant downscaling effect of PAR in RS-driven models14,43. The accuracy of the LUE model was improved by refining the PAR scalar with different downscaling slopes, especially in periods of high PAR values.\\n\\nCompared with the results obtained from flux-tower measurements, the modeled GPP was basically within the confidence interval of the measured results. The annual averages of GPP in Zhangjiang were 1729 g C/m2/year and 1924 g C/m2/year, in 2012 and 2016, and the annual mean value of GPP in Zhanjiang was 1434 g C/m2/year in 2015. The previous study showed that the GPP in Zhangjiang ranged from 1763 to 1919 g C/m2/year with a mean value of 1871 g C/m2/year32,44,45, which is in good agreement with the estimated values obtained in this study. Liu and Lai46 reported that the GPP of the Mai Po mangrove reserve was 2827 g C/m2/year. Rodda, et al.20 found a GPP value of 1271 g C/m2/year for Sunderbans mangroves in India. Gnanamoorthy, et al.47 estimated a GPP of 2305 g C/m2/year for Pichavaram mangroves. Variations in these estimates across sites were possibly caused by different climate-hydrological conditions, mangrove species, and ages. Differences in the same location may be due to different time scales and different methods of data gap filling and flux partitioning.\\n\\nIn a similar way to the GPP model for terrestrial ecosystems48, the effect of the mangrove GPP model on the accuracy of GPP estimates can vary considerably under different environmental conditions. However, in comparison with the accuracy of models built for other vegetation types, the GPP model in this study performed substantially in two sites with RMSE of 2.54–3.41 g C/m2/day. Wang et al.49 adopted different models to estimate GPP for global vegetation and validation results showed the RMSE ranged from 1.79 to 2.33 g C/m2/day. Xiao, et al.50 demonstrated that the deviation between observed and predicted GPP was about 35–282 g C/m2 in an evergreen needleleaf forest. Also, the absolute GPP errors were 7.94–20.92% and 9.97–13.70% for maize cropland and degraded grassland36. Despite the discrepancy, our results were generally consistent with previous studies and were verified by field observations near the flux towers.\\n\\nThe comparison of MODIS GPP and EC-estimated GPP showed that the MODIS GPP had a large fluctuation and weakly reflected productivity, being overestimated in 2012 and underestimated in 2015. Different meteorological inputs, different environmental scalars and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (fAPAR) products in MODIS GPP and our mangrove GPP model can explain their different results. However, the improvements in our GPP model may help to obtain more accurate GPP estimates. The response of mangrove productivity to T air has not been well-calibrated in the MODIS GPP product, which may partly account for the poor correlation between the MODIS GPP and EC estimates. Besides, MODIS GPP product was developed based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover map, which doesn’t include mangroves as a specific land cover37. Therefore, LUE max and environmental parameters were not defined for mangroves, which varied with different environments. This may lead to uncertainty in MODIS GPP product for mangrove forests14. However, the GPP model generated in our study showed similar trends to the field measurements, capturing seasonal variations. The increase in the difference between MODIS GPP and EC estimates may be due to the assumption that the increase in GPP is linear with respect to PAR. In our model, the response of GPP to PAR was suppressed, resulting in seasonal changes in GPP that better match the observations. In addition, the GPP derived from this study was in higher agreement with measured values compared with GPP estimated from the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM), as shown in Fig. S4. The improvement of this model was more obvious in winter (December to February), which may be due to the environmental stress of SST and PAR. The VPM without considering SST scalar and PAR scalar overestimated GPP in winter. It is indicated that the performance of the mangrove GPP model in this study varied with season. It is recommended to improve the estimation of GPP in the future by considering the seasonal variation of mangrove forests when determining environmental variables.\\n\\nMost studies provide EC-based estimates of GPP that are measurements from a limited footprint. It is possible to extrapolate results across similar vegetation types and geographic settings, but not to areas of heterogeneous vegetation. The RS-based GPP model offers spatial-scale estimates that can be directly incorporated into ecosystem-type models. PAR, SST, and salinity are the key environmental parameters of this RS-based mangrove GPP model. SST and salinity data were derived from the satellite images, while PAR was generated from the reconstructed PAR data, since it is more accurate than the existing RS data and has historical year data. However, PAR products from Hamawari-8, MERIS, and SeaWiFS are available now, which provide an opportunity to obtain large-scale PAR data using RS in the future. In addition to this, GPP of two mangrove forests was assessed and validated with three-year measurements. Validation at different sites and years showed similar results, which indicated the model has similar performance across mangrove forests. Nonetheless, these estimates need to be corroborated with EC databases, which are relatively accurate and provide many additional variables that are currently beyond the scope of higher spatial-resolution RS estimates. The proposed GPP model considering coastal environments was well suited to extend the study area by incorporating RS information and meteorological data. Currently, there are still few mangrove carbon flux towers worldwide. The LUE and GPP models proposed in this study are difficult to validate with measurements from flux towers in other countries. However, local measurements are available in many countries with large mangrove forests, such as Thailand, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh. Therefore, it is expected that comparisons with measurements from previous studies can be conducted to show the consistency and applicability.\\n\\nThe LUE model considering the effects of SST, salinity, and PAR performed well, however, the GPP estimated from the LUE, fAPAR, and PAR showed discrepancies and were generally lower than the measured values. Although the results are better than MODIS GPP products, limitations exist still.\\n\\nFirstly, the effects of salinity and SST on mangrove productivity were directly related to tidal activities. The soil pore water and surface water salinity could affect the osmotic pressure of mangroves especially for the submerged parts which would control the stomatal conductance. In the same way, SST could influence the temperature of mangrove root systems and soil sediments which has impacts on mangrove roots’ respiration and transpiration. Although, theoretically, salinity and SST should be considered as environmental variables affecting mangrove LUE, our results (Fig. S3) indicated that salinity and SST have little influence on mangrove productivity51. To date, the quantitative impact of SST has not been comprehensively unfolded, but it is a global control that determines the upper limit of the latitudinal range of mangroves12,33. The weak relationships between salinity, SST, and mangrove GPP could be due to the uncertainty caused by tidal inundation. Tide duration, tide height, and tide cycle would determine the effect of salinity and SST on the mangrove LUE and GPP. However, quantifying the influence from the tidal cycle remains a challenging task, which could result in the relatively poor performance of Salinity scalar and SST scalar as shown in Fig. S3. Quantifying the soil temperature and surface water salinity considering the tidal cycle will contribute to model the LUE and GPP of mangrove forests.\\n\\nSecondly, mangroves of different species and ages exhibit diverse structural and physical conditions, resulting in different LUE max , and optimal growing conditions such as T opt and VPD min . The environmental settings would also vary from region to region. Liu and Lai46 found that LUE increased slightly with the increasing salinity below 15 ppt (R2 = 0.16). However, it was noted that photosynthetic activity of mangroves would be inhibited when the surface water salinity was high30,51,52,53. Probably, the mutual relationship between LUE and salinity depends on the salinity level and mangrove species. However, we have not specified the variables for different mangrove species, ages and locations which could be improved in the future. Besides, there are multicollinearities between different environmental variables. For example, T air may have effects on SST and VPD, but as shown in Fig. S5, they are all important for mangrove photosynthesis. However, the correlations between them are not clear and need to be quantified in the future.\\n\\nThirdly, the relatively low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental data from RS would influence the accuracy of the model. The datasets have a relatively coarse resolution (usually 500 m–1 km and daily) and are thereby less suitable for smaller nature reserves, especially in the narrow patches of mangrove areas that are rapidly being exploited in coastal China. Moreover, the variability in LUE decreases with increasing temporal scale54. In our study, we determined the PAR scalar based on the response of LUE to hourly-scale PAR and found the different down-regulation effects with increasing PAR. However, this phenomenon is not obvious in previous studies. Most RS-based LUE models were developed at a daily or 8-day temporal scale6,50,55,56,57. In terrestrial forests, the light saturated effect caused by increasing PAR was neglectable with coarse temporal scale because the average PAR was usually lower than the LSP. However, as the time scale increases, the effect of light saturation on LUE becomes more pronounced32,58,59. More importantly, this effect is more obvious in mangroves due to their lower LSP18,38, which makes it important in mangrove LUE modeling. The results in Fig. 3 show similar performances of LUE model on hourly and daily scale. Thus, we suggested that our model can be adopted in hourly and daily temporal resolution. However, the PAR scalar developed in this study was based on the mangrove forests in one study site which may be influenced by the mangrove species with different LSP and light conditions. What’s more, VPD was on a monthly scale, which cannot reflect environmental dynamics. However, the hourly and daily VPD data are currently not available for coastal areas in China. Therefore, we used monthly averages to represent daily VPD, which may lead to uncertainty in the derived GPP estimates (Figs. 6 and 7). Besides, porewater salinity is controlled by sea surface salinity, precipitation, and river discharge. However, currently, pore water salinity was expressed in terms of sea surface salinity, which may lead to an underestimation of Salinity scalar . More systematic study is necessary to make it more applicable and accurate on a large scale, of which modeling the LUE for different mangrove species and locations is inevitable. However, serving as a fundamental and preliminary step, our study aims to provide a framework for RS-based mangrove GPP modeling. Recently, with the advancement of satellite imagery, hourly-scale RS data for PAR, temperature and SST are available. It can be expected that our current work could be further improved by investigating the light saturation effects in different mangrove forests and adopt higher temporal resolution RS products such as Himawari-8 and GCOM-C in the future.\\n\\nLastly, the overall underestimation of GPP was mainly caused by the underestimation of fAPAR. Even though the fAPAR computed from Sentinel-2 had higher resolution and accuracy than MODIS fAPAR products, future improvements are still needed. Sentinel-2 fAPAR products (fAPAR-S2) was calculated as the instantaneous fAPAR obtained at 10:00 local solar time which only roughly represented the daily average but was not accurate. Besides, RS-derived fAPAR only considers the absorptions by living green vegetation elements, whereas the ground measured fAPAR refers to the contributions from all absorbing components60. The lower fAPAR-S2 values in mangrove forests may be due to the exposed-to-air root systems which absorb the radiation. Moreover, the spatial distribution of PAR was determined by Co-Kriging interpolation. The elevation was taken as the covariate to estimate spatial PAR. There are many other variables affecting the incoming PAR (e.g., slope and clearness)61. A more comprehensive set of variables needs to be included in the Co-kriging interpolation to improve the PAR estimation.\\n\\nThe spatial and seasonal variations of the mangrove GPP were related to environmental changes along the shoreline. The low summer GPP was explained by the lower fAPAR in summer compared with other seasons, which was principally due to the underestimation of fAPAR in summer. Furthermore, PAR scalar took a mean value of LSP as 1 mmol/m2/s, however, LSP varied with different species and environmental conditions. In summer, mangroves are more likely to obtain light saturation, and thus PAR scalar may lead to an underestimation of LUE and thus GPP. On the contrary, PAR values in winter were relatively low but increased slightly with decreasing latitude. Thus, the inhibitory effect of PAR on LUE was not significant, and GPP increased with decreasing latitude. Salinity and VPD were more stable across years and locations and had no noticeable effect on the mangrove LUE and GPP. The seasonal latitudinal patterns and effects on mangrove productivity were similar for T air and SST. T air and SST were lower in winter, especially at high latitudes where mangroves were more sensitive to cold weather. Therefore, the GPP of mangroves at high latitudes in winter was the lowest throughout the year. However, hot weather in summer also limited the photosynthesis in mangroves, especially at low latitudes, where T air and SST were higher. Nevertheless, there were some correlations among these environmental constants. For example, the T air affects the vapor pressure and SST. There was a positive correlation between PAR and T air . The multicollinearity among these variables and the various conditions of mangroves may affect the performance of the model and show variations along the coastline, which would be improved in future studies.\\n\\nAdditionally, the GPP of mangroves increased from 2007 to 2018, which was mainly due to the expansion of mangrove forests in the coastal areas. As mangroves grow, canopy size and tree density increase, which may lead to higher LUE and less underestimation of fAPAR, thus contributing to high productivity. However, Zhejiang province (27° 02′ N–31° 11′ N) experienced extremely cold weather in January 2016 caused by the East Asia cold wave62,63, and large areas of mangrove forests died or became sick, leading to a decline in the mangrove GPP at high latitudes in 2018.',\n",
              " 'Empirical findings\\n\\nWe stratify cyclone exposure intensities into three bins. Bin 1 represents “direct” exposure and includes administrative units that were located within 100 km of the cyclone’s “eye”. Bins 2 and 3 represent “indirect” exposure and include administrative units that were situated within 100 km to 200 km and 200 km to 300 km of the cyclone’s “eye”, respectively. We consider administrative units located within the latter distances to the cyclone’s eye to be subject to “indirect” exposure, because these areas represent locations that were likely exposed to lower wind intensities and shorter exposure durations. Within each bin of exposure, we further stratify our sample into four subsamples: low and narrow, high and narrow, low and wide and high and wide. “Low” selects administrative units into the subsample if the mean elevation is less than 50 m and “narrow” selects administrative units into the subsample if their average mangrove width is less than 10 m of mangroves from the seaward boundary per m of coastline. Consequently, “high” corresponds to a mean elevation of 50 m or more, and “wide” is average mangrove extent equal to or greater than 10 m per m of coastline.\\n\\nThe cumulative impact of cyclone exposure on economic activity is measured across five annual lags for all 12 datasets (3 bins each with 4 subsamples). For example, the fifth lag (representing the exposure year and four years into the future) for bin one and subsample 1 captures the persistent and cumulative impact of direct cyclone exposure on economic activity in low-lying administrative units that have narrow mangrove coverage (Fig. 1A).\\n\\nFigure 1 Five-year cumulative impact of tropical cyclone exposure on the growth trend in economic activity. (A) represents direct exposure within 100 km of a cyclone’s “eye” and (B,C) represent indirect exposure from 100 to 200 km of a cyclone’s and 200 km to 300 km of a cyclone’s “eye”. “Low” includes administrative units with a mean elevation < 50 m and “high” corresponds to mean elevation ≥ 50 m. “Narrow” includes administrative units with average mangrove width < 10 m of mangroves from the seaward boundary per m of coastline, and “wide” is average mangrove width ≥ 10 m per m coastline. 95% confidence intervals are provided around point estimates. Full size image\\n\\nWe find that direct exposure has a permanent impact on long-run economic outcomes in the absence of natural protections that buffer winds or reduce storm surge inundation (Table 1). Five years following exposure, point estimates show a 10% to 22% loss in economic activity when compared to pre-cyclone trends (Fig. 1A). However, for those coastal communities at high elevation with wide mangroves, we estimate a statistically insignificant point effect of − 4.6% (Fig. 1A). Whereas the cumulative effect of exposure on “unprotected” communities continues to worsen in the fifth year, results suggest that cyclone exposure disrupts economic activity in coastal communities in the year of impact and in subsequent years following exposure (Table 1). High elevation and wide mangroves, together, buffer this initial impact of storm exposure and enable communities to return to pre-exposure growth rates quickly, thus avoiding long-term impacts on economic activity. In the case of direct exposure, elevation or mangroves alone appear incapable of sheltering economic activity.For indirect exposure, we find that mangroves or elevation alone have the capacity to generate tremendous storm protection benefits (Fig. 1B,C and Table 1). For those exposed between 100 and 200 km of the cyclone’s eye, low elevation communities with narrow mangroves experienced a 17.0% reduction in long-run economic growth, which was reduced to 9.0% for similarly low elevation communities with wide mangroves (Fig. 1B). Likewise, for those communities exposed between 200 and 300 km of the cyclone’s eye, low elevation communities with narrow mangroves experienced a 12.9% reduction in long-run economic growth, which was reduced to 5.5% for similarly low elevation communities with wide mangroves (Fig. 1C). For these indirect exposures, high elevation has a substantial benefit for those communities with narrow mangroves, but this benefit from being at high elevation appears dampened for those coastal communities that already have wide mangroves.\\n\\nTable 1 Five-year cumulative effects of cyclone exposure on growth rate in economic activity across four subsamples (low and high elevation coastal communities, narrow and wide mangroves) and three bins of direct and indirect exposure (“eye” of the storm passing within 100 km, 100–200 km and 200–300 km of coastal community). Full size table\\n\\nFor indirect exposures, it appears storm protection services from mangroves are substitutable for increased elevation, whereas for direct exposures, it appears mangroves and elevation are necessary complements to sheltering long-run economic growth from cyclones. Importantly, for all direct exposure specifications, including the case of combined elevation and mangrove protections, the cumulative effect continues to increase, albeit taper off in magnitude, 5 years following exposure.\\n\\nDistributional analysis\\n\\nWith climate predictions of increased frequency of intense storm events, our work presents three key findings. First, low-lying coastal areas require wide mangrove forests of at least 10 m width from the seaward boundary per m of coastline to buffer long-term losses to economic activity—narrow bands of mangroves provide little protection. Second, even wide mangroves are only capable of sheltering those communities exposed indirectly to cyclones. Third, for coastal safe havens to be sheltered against increasingly intense storm events requires both high elevation (≥ 50 m) and wide mangroves.\\n\\nAlthough our sample contains nearly 400 million individuals with mangroves along the coastline of their community (Tables 2 and S1A–D), approximately 60 million have wide enough mangroves in low-lying areas to generate protection from an indirect exposure event (Table S1C). These communities are located overwhelmingly in lower-middle income countries (38.4%) and within developing countries in Latin America and Caribbean (34.0%) and East Asian and Pacific (32.8%) countries. We estimate only 10.9% of this population is in the developed world. These coastal communities within lower-middle income countries appear to be concentrated behind a relatively small share of the world’s expansive mangroves (34.7%) compared to upper-middle income countries that have 10.9% of the sample population but 52.4% of the mangrove coverage.\\n\\nTable 2 2010 sample total population and mangrove coverage summary statistics for full sample of 102 territories and countries and 2549 coastal communities. Full size table\\n\\nEven in the absence of wide mangrove coverage, high elevation is sufficient to generate protection from an indirect exposure event. Such high elevation coastal communities without wide mangrove coverage account for approximately 140 million people globally (Table S1B). Over 75% of this population is located within developing countries with the majority located in East Asia and Pacific developing countries (55.4%). Despite 49.1% of “narrow” mangroves in high elevation areas being located in Latin America and Caribbean developing countries, these areas only account for 11.5% of the relevant global population. These high elevation and narrow mangrove populations are evenly distributed among lower-middle income (38.4%) and upper-middle income (35.5%) countries. However, 55.2% of such mangrove coverage is located within upper-middle income countries as compared to 25.7% in lower-middle income countries.\\n\\nProtection from direct exposure events requires high elevation and wide mangrove coverage. We find that 28% of global mangrove coverage (approximately 504 million m2) has a seaward width more than 10 m along communities with mean elevation > 50 m (Table S1D). These areas represent “safe havens” from direct and indirect exposure from cyclones and are located overwhelmingly in upper-middle income countries (65.7%). Yet, 47.2% of populations in these areas reside in lower-middle income countries whereas only 45.4% of populations in these areas reside in upper-middle income countries (Table S1D). Based on population (93.9%) and mangrove coverage (93.2%) distributions, we find that these “safe havens” are located disproportionately in developing countries.\\n\\nWe find that the majority of people receiving coastal topographic and mangrove protections from indirect storm exposures are concentrated in few countries. Coastal populations with low elevation and wide mangroves are located overwhelmingly in Indonesia (18.7%), Brazil (15.4%), Nigeria (10.9%), Malaysia (10.0%) and USA (9.0%), which together account for 63.9% of the global population in such areas. Coastal populations with high elevation and narrow mangroves are concentrated in Indonesia (30.9%), China (22.0%), Saudi Arabia (10.2%), Malaysia (7.0%) and Mexico (4.5%), which together account for 74.5% of the global population in such areas (country-level data provided in supplementary materials).\\n\\nCoastal “safe havens” that provide the unique combination of topography and mangrove coverage to shelter against direct storm exposures are also concentrated among few countries. Indonesia (41.7%) and Brazil (11.8%) have over 15.8 million people accounting for 53.5% of the global population in such areas. Including Malaysia (9.8%), Mexico (6.9%) and Jamaica (3.2%) drives the global share of “safe haven” populations to 73.4%, or 21.8 million individuals. Although Indonesia contains the largest “safe haven” population, the within-country distribution of this population is also concentrated. The four regencies (second-level administrative subdivision) with the largest “safe haven” populations are Cilacap, Deli Serdang, Banyuwangi and Sumenep, which, account for 6.7 million people or 54.4% of the Indonesian “safe haven” population. Together, these four Indonesian regencies alone represent 22.7% of the global “safe haven” population.',\n",

Kavi Kumar of the Madras School of Economics say that in addition to fish catch, mangroves also add value with other ecosystem services. These include wood, coastal protection, erosion control, carbon sequestration, water purification, tourism, recreation, education and research. Coastal protection and carbon sequestration alone added up to Rs 754 billion and Rs 1.65 billion in 2012-13 prices.\\n\\nMangroves make for 4,740 square kilometres or 0.14% of India’s geographical area.

Young fish grow in the secure maze of breathing roots before venturing into the sea. The researcher duo used an econometric analysis model to predict the technical efficiency of fish production in these mangroves. They used a stochastic ‘frontier production function’ to estimate the maximum potential output from territorial waters of each state housing mangroves. They found that states on the western coast of India – Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra – have higher technical efficiency than those on the eastern coast such as Odisha and Puducherry. However, real catch could also be limited by other variables like production inefficiencies and impact of state policies and support, they say.\\n\\n“The mean value of technical efficiency is estimated to be about 45%, which implies that these states on an average could increase marine fish output by 55% without additional resources but through more efficient use of existing inputs and technology,” Anneboina and Kumar note.\\n\\nThe authors used annual fish production statistics from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). They also considered variables such as the state government’s plan outlay, financial and policy support for the fisheries sector, and the total number of marine fishing vessels while computing efficiency.\\n\\nEvery square kilometer of mangroves was estimated to increase fish production by 185.84 tonne.

              " 'We found that mangrove deforestation is often, but not always, associated with high levels of mangrove fragmentation, and the strength of this relationship varies regionally. Changes in the fragmentation metrics for the nearest patch and mean patch size can either increase or decrease when mangroves are lost. Changes in mean distance to the nearest neighbour could be caused by edges of patches being lost, single large patches being broken into multiple smaller patches or entire patches being lost. If entire patches are lost, the mean distance metric can increase or decrease, depending on the position of the remaining patches. Changes in mean patch size may be driven by either the loss of entire patches, single patches fragmenting or a reduction in patch size. Therefore, where total areal loss coincides with either positive or negative shifts in these metrics, the function of mangrove ecosystems is likely to be compromised27,28. Accordingly, areas identified as hotspots for either loss (such as Brazil) or fragmentation (such as Cameroon) are likely to have compromised mangrove functionality.\\n\\nSoutheast Asia is one of the major areas of concern for mangrove conservation because it has the highest mangrove tree species diversity33, the greatest areal extent of mangrove forest globally, and high deforestation rates10. Although mean nearest patch and mean inter-patch distance are both highly correlated to loss in this region (Supplementary Table S1) the discrepancies between the two metrics highlight how different types of land-use change might impair ecological condition differently. Distance to the nearest neighbour and patch size are important for maintaining migration corridors and patch residency, respectively, meaning that distinct drivers of deforestation (not just the extent of deforestation) may have differing effects on mangrove ecosystem functionality. For example, in landscapes dominated by mangrove regrowth (including regions with mangrove forestry), loss is highly correlated with mean patch size (r = 0.72) and less so for nearest mangrove forest (r = 0.31). Accordingly, mangrove forestry may adversely impact the capacity of a forest to harbour species, without affecting its suitability as a faunal migration corridor.\\n\\nWe found the correlation between deforestation and fragmentation depends on what land-use mangroves were converted to. Mangrove deforestation and fragmentation were more strongly linked for conversion to aquaculture or rice paddies than for conversion to oil-palm plantations. Conversion to oil palm plantations may occur as single continuous blocks from the landward side, often removing larger and contiguous forest patches. In contrast, conversion to rice paddies or aquaculture may occur as many smaller intrusions and thus fragment mangroves more acutely. Such piecemeal encroachment has been observed for rice paddies in the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar34 and for aquaculture in the Mahakam Delta, Indonesia35.\\n\\nThe indirect relationship between loss, fragmentation and land-use change implies that if fragmentation and loss are considered separately management authorities may develop different conservation/restoration objectives. However, if both these degrading forces are considered in tandem, policies may shift towards encouraging/allowing different land-uses in different areas to maximise mangrove ecosystem services. Importantly, not all forms of land-use changes degrade mangroves uniformly. Mangroves converted for aquaculture can naturally recover if left undisturbed36, while other land-uses range between permanency (e.g. urban developments and oil palm plantations) and transiency (e.g. mangrove forestry)37. Future studies should seek to identify the impacts of fragmentation on mangrove ecosystems and understand how mangrove regrowth and restoration can reconnect fragmented forests.\\n\\nAn important caveat to the data we used was that it does not measure mangrove expansion outside of its original mapped area in 2000. Mangroves are expanding in some places38,39 and are being intentionally replanted in others40. However, over the timescale we analysed, cases of mangrove expansion and regrowth are likely to be rare relative to that of deforestation. Future studies could use new remotely sensed products, such as the Global Mangrove Watch dataset41, that measure both loss and growth of forests, to better understand how mangrove expansion may reconnect fragmented patches over longer timescales.\\n\\nRemote sensing has facilitated large-scale mapping and the identification of conservation issues in increasingly high detail. Powerful datasets are being developed and updated regularly that allow practitioners to monitor conservation efforts with greater efficiency. Current products with large datasets of long temporal scale (such as Landsat) could be analysed using metrics or methods that assess both the areal extent and spatial arrangement of habitats. This would provide opportunities to monitor ecological degradation and the efficacy of conservation efforts in a level of detail that was previously impossible.\\n\\nIn this work we have identified patterns in fragmentation of mangrove forests globally, considering measures of forest extent, layout and utility to organisms. We found that areas already highlighted as hotspots of mangrove loss (Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar) are often associated with elevated levels of fragmentation. However, fragmentation is a far more ubiquitous form of environmental change than loss, with regional hotspots in areas otherwise considered low concern in assessments of mangrove status globally. Large-scale mangrove monitoring efforts should include fragmentation metrics and consider fragmentation alongside shifts in the area of mangrove forests. The ecological impacts of fragmentation in this intertidal habitat needs to be considered if we are to fully grasp the societal ramifications of this ubiquitous threat to mangrove health.']"

Degraded mangrove areas between 1975 and 2020 were identified using Landsat images and field verification of the specific sites. The SBR was divided into 5609 grids using a 1 km grid to understand the nature of mangrove degradation and modeling purpose (Fig. 3). Landsat MSS (1975) and Landsat 8 OLI (2020) satellite data were utilized for preparing a land use/landcover map of the SBR using a supervised classification technique. The classification accuracy was assessed through the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient. Overall accuracy was found 87.62% for 1975 and 94.9% for 2020 and the kappa coefficient values was 0.89 for 1975 and 0.96 for 2020. Post classification change matrix technique was used to prepare land use/land cover change map during 1975 and 2020. The area under vegetation cover and mangrove was extracted from the land use land cover map. NDVI maps during different seasons were utilized to improve the accuracy of the vegetation cover map of the SBR. Ten influencing drivers were selected for analyzing the habitat suitability of mangrove forests (Table 1). The details of the methodological framework are presented in Fig. 2.\\n\\nTable 1 Major drivers of mangrove degradation in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. Full size table\\n\\nFigure 2 Methodological framework of the study. Full size image\\n\\nOccurrence data\\n\\nWe selected 18 dominant mangrove species in Indian Sundarban for preparing a habitat suitability model (Table 2). The occurrence data of the selected mangrove species have been collected from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the existing published literature68,69. The occurrence data were collected from the published sources70,71,72,73,74 and field survey using a grid-based stratified random sampling approach during 2018\\u20132019. We received help from the local fisherman, crab and honey collector to identify mangrove species and collected samples from the core forest areas. The total grids were divided into 19 strata as per the administrative blocks for an easy process and 50 samples were selected from each stratum. In this way, a total of 950 occurrence locations were selected from the field survey (Fig. 3). The secondary occurrence data was verified through google earth images to avoid duplication. Further, the occurrence data was run through a statistical assessment using spatially rarefied in ArcGIS SDM toolbox by selecting a single point grid cell for individual species (1 km grid). Finally, we selected a total of 1560 occurrence data (707 from the archive sources and 853 from the field survey (Table 2) to develop species distribution models.\\n\\nTable 2 Details of the selected mangrove species and the occurrence data. Full size table\\n\\nFigure 3 A grid-based field survey (2018\\u20132019) has been conducted to collect the species occurrence data of 18 mangrove species. (The satellite images are obtained from the ArcGIS google earth base map. The species occurrence locations were collected through Garmin eTrex 32 \\u00d7 Outdoor Handheld GPS and the maps were prepared using ArcGIS 10.8.2 software [https://desktop.arcgis.com].) Full size image\\n\\nData preparation and variable selection\\n\\nAfter a detailed literature review and field knowledge, we considered 36 variables from 6 different parameters for the present study. The data source, data structure, spatial resolution, and references of the data have been provided in Appendix 1. All the raster variables were re-sampled into 1 km resolution using resample tool in ArcGIS to match the original resolution of WorldClim data and the 1 km sampling grid76. All 30-m raster images were reclassified into 1 km grid cell and the average number of pixels over 5609 girds in Sundarban were determined to be 33,334. From the topographical parameters, we selected six important variables (Appendix 2A) namely, elevation, slope, curvature, geomorphology, topographic wetness index (TWI), and stream power index (SPI) (Appendix 1). All the selected topographical variables were intricately linked with the tidal inundation and temperature, which can directly influence the distribution of mangrove species77. From environmental parameters, 6 variables (Appendix 2B) were selected namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), level of flood inundation, mean tidal range, storm surge height, normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and rate of erosion/accretion (Appendix 1). Mangroves are known as salt-tolerant higher groups of coastal plants78 which are mainly flourish in the backwater, estuaries, creeks, and lagoons. These flowering plants are inundated and exposed two times a day during high tide and low tide with coastal marine water and grow up by the mixture of the freshwater flow from upstream. Thus, water is a very important parameter for assessing mangrove habitat suitability. Six variables were selected as underwater parameters namely water surface temperature, water salinity, PH value, distance from water, drainage density, and modified normalized difference water index (Appendix 2C). All these variables are directly associated with the growth and distribution of mangrove species in Sundarban (Appendix 1). Soil is considered an influencing parameter along with climate for the distribution of flora at spatial scales1,79. However, few studies have considered soil variables in modeling mangrove distribution52. Six important variables namely soil texture, soil salinity index, soil fertility index, sediment yield factor (Ton), electronic conductivity (EC), and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI) were selected to examine the influence of soil (Appendix 2D).\\n\\nBioclimatic layers are one of the popular variables widely used by various scholars in order to build species distribution and ecological niche modeling80. Many researchers have also used the bioclimatic variables for mangrove habitat suitability models because of their association with climate-related phenomena, especially temperature and precipitation81. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to remove the data redundancy and avoid the random error and uncertainty of the model (Appendix 3). Of the 19 variables only the most suitable 6 bioclimatic variable layers were used for this study: BIO1, Annual Mean Temperature; BIO2, Mean Diurnal Range; BIO3, Isothermality; BIO4, Temperature Seasonality, BIO12 = Annual Precipitation and BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Appendix 2E) Anthropogenic activities are the main factors for the decrease in areas under mangroves globally82, Sundarban is no exception to this encroachment. Six disturbance variables namely distance from the road, road density, distance from Settlement, population density, distance from agriculture field, and embankment density were selected for habitat suitability analysis based on local knowledge (Appendix 2F).\\n\\nVariable performance for habitat suitability model\\n\\nModel collinearity among the variables was checked to avoid the negative influence of variables on the performance of the model. The predictive ability of all individual variables was tested before performing the suitability model83. The linear support vector machine (LSVM) model was utilized for assessing the prediction capacity of variables. LSVM can be expressed as:\\n\\n$$g(x)=Sgn({w}^{T}a+b)$$\\n\\nwhere, \\\\({w}^{T}\\\\) is the weight matrix of the habitat suitability variables, \\\\(a=\\\\) (a 1 , a 2 \\u2026a 14 ) vector inputs of the variables, \\\\(b\\\\) is the offset from the origin of the hyper-plane. The variables ith with the weight \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\) close to 0 has a smaller effect on the prediction than the one with larger values of \\\\({w}_{i}\\\\). The average merit (AM) for each variable and its ability for prediction ranged between 1 and 10 (Table 3). The values > 5 represent the potential influencing variables for habitat suitability model.\\n\\nTable 3 Intrinsic and extrinsic model evaluation scores for each species. Full size table\\n\\nModel development and validation\\n\\nThe habitat suitability models for 18 selected mangrove species were constructed using ten algorithms through the biomod2 package in R studio. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models can be set up in the R studio package for getting different complex conditions and properties which can give a possible higher accuracy on the species distribution model84. For the present study, we performed 10-machine learning algorithms: (1) MAXENT: Maximum Entropy; (2) GLM: Generalized Linear Model; (3) MARS: Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines; (4) GAM: Generalized Additive Model; (5) RF: Random Forest; (6) GBM: Boosted Regression Trees model; (7) CTA: Classification Tree Analysis, (8) ANN: Artificial Neural Network; (9) FDA: Flexible Discriminant Analysis and (10) SRE: Surface Range Envelop model. The performance of all ten models has been assessed through the intrinsic model building process and extrinsic validation methods. For this, we have split the occurrence data into 80% for training and 20% for testing the model. For creating the intrinsic model, we randomly used 75% of the occurrence data for training the model and the remaining 25% for testing each individual model. The modeling process was run for 18 different species using 10 machine learning algorithms. In this way, 180 models were run. Cohen's Kappa (KAPPA), true skill statistic (TSS), and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) models were used for validated all the individual models.\\n\\nFinally, for the extrinsic evaluation, the algorithms which have > 0.75 predicting performance for all the validation models (KAPPA, TSS, and ROC) were used to build the final ensemble model (Appendix 4). We have used the ensemble forecast method using a weighted mean approach in biomod2 packages within R studio for producing the final habitat suitability models for all the selected species. The final habitat suitability models for all 18 species were again validated through the Boyce index (BI) using the 20% data which were kept aside for validation85 (Table 3). The output habitat suitability raster index from the ensemble models for all species was then categorized into four classes namely highly suitable, moderately suitable, slightly suitable, and not suitable.\\n\\nNiche overlap analysis and setting restoration prioritization\\n\\nModified Hellinger metric (I) and Schoener's index of niche breadth (D) were used to estimate the niche overlap among 18 species. The spatial similarity and dissimilarity of niche area for the selected species has been calculate using the raster calculator spatial overlay function in ArcGIS.\\n\\nWe have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to prepare a restoration priority rank for all 18 species based on their niche characteristics, estimated potential distribution, local knowledge, and degradation status.\\n\\nIdentification of restoration prioritize grids\\n\\nPercentage of niche overlap data, restoration priority rank for all species, habitat suitability maps for all individual species, percentage of mangrove cover, mangrove degradation rate, mangrove accretion rate, and human disturbance rate were used as input functions for identifying the restoration prioritized grids over 5609 girds in Sundarban. Grid-wise total mangrove area for the present scenario was calculated from the land use/land cover map for 2020. A grid-wise mangrove degradation rate and mangrove accretion rate have been calculated using the land use land cover change between 1975 and 2020. The human disturbance rate was calculated using the following equation:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{HDR}=\\\\frac{(BR+NP+RD+AR)}{1km}*100$$\\n\\nwhere HDR is the human disturbance rate, BR is the percentage of built-up area in each grid, NP is the number of populations in each grid, RD = road density in each grid and AR is the percentage of agricultural area in each grid.\\n\\nFor the preparation of final restoration prioritize grids we developed a species-wise grid-based algorithm using the FactomineR package in R studio. The final output of the species level restoration prioritize grids were assessed by using negative and positive indicators function. The negative indicators included: (1) > 80% present mangrove cover grid in 2020, (2) HDR value more than > 75%, (3) not suitable and slightly suitable grids, (4) natural accretion rate as > 75%. The positive indicators for this algorithm involved: (1) restoration priority rank for each individual species, (2) niche overlap grid for each individual species (P < 0.05), (3) highly and moderately suitability grids for each individual species, (4) degradation date > 75%.\",\n          \"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies .

Credit: Maruyama Mori/IB-CLP-UNESP\\n\\nIn Brazil's North region, members of the population of red mangrove trees (Rhizophora mangle) do not often meet relatives from the South and vice-versa. However, occasional migrations via ocean currents between the two regions involving propagules, seeds adapted to seawater, enable populations to exchange genetic material and remain connected during their evolution.\\n\\nThis is one of the conclusions of a study reported in the journal Molecular Ecology Resources by Brazilian and Japanese researchers.\\n\\nMangrove forests form a unique wetland ecosystem, inhabiting the edge of land and sea, rooted and thriving in seawater. Mangroves play a vital role in coastal ecology and in sustaining and securing coastal communities.\\n\\nRhizophora is one of the main mangrove genera, found in all regions of the planet, and red mangrove is distributed in estuarine ecosystems throughout the tropics. Transoceanic dispersal and the cosmopolitan presence of the genus make it a good model for in-depth analysis of coastal ecology. Studies of red mangroves in Brazil can also help prioritize conservation areas, as they are important nurseries for various marine species and store large amounts of carbon.\\n\\n\\\"Research along these lines helps identify places where mangroves are releasing many propagules in both the North and Northeast and the South and Southeast of Brazil. It could be worthwhile creating conservation units in these areas,\\\" said Andr\\u00e9 Guilherme Madeira, first author of the article.\\n\\n\\\"We collected DNA samples from trees of the species all over Brazil. The genetic data matched simulations of ocean currents, which also showed that propagules aren't carried very far from their parent mangroves. In sum, we have two practically isolated populations, one in the North/Northeast and the other in the South/Southeast,\\\" said Gustavo Maruyama Mori, last author of the article and a professor at IB-CLP-UNESP.\\n\\nThe study served as the basis for the project \\\"Evaluating adaptation, epigenetic variation, and dispersal to unveil the response of mangrove in a changing world.\\\"\\n\\nCross-referenced data\\n\\nMangrove propagules are not in fact seeds properly speaking, but embryos that become fully mature plants before dropping off the parent tree. They are dispersed by water until they embed in the shallows. They can survive for about a year in saltwater, freshwater or brackish water before germinating. In Rhizophora, they are green, cylindrical and pointed. They are commonly found floating in the sea near beaches in Brazil.\\n\\nUsing mathematical models of floating and ten-year ocean current data, the researchers simulated propagule dispersal at 11 sites along the coast of Brazil, from Salin\\u00f3polis, Par\\u00e1 state, in the North to Florian\\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina state, in the South. In the simulations, propagules were assumed to germinate whenever they stopped on the coast in the period 2010-20.\\n\\n\\\"Red mangrove populations in Brazil are fairly isolated. They don't communicate with each other. However, one or another propagule occasionally reaches an ocean current that takes it farther than usual. These long-distance dispersal events are rare but can be significant,\\\" Madeira said.\\n\\nThe hypothesis was compatible with the genetic data, which showed an ancestral connection between the populations on a scale of thousands of years but little or none in recent generations.\\n\\nOther more variable factors, such as coastal currents and air dispersal of pollen, may contribute to an exchange of genetic material between populations, complementing the hypothesis, but data is not available for these parameters in the populations analyzed to confirm the possibility.\\n\\nThe researchers now plan to apply the same approach to mangroves in other parts of the world, this time cross-referencing data from oceanographic simulations with molecular data for mangroves compiled by other research groups, in order to understand whether the findings for Brazil are part of a global pattern or only local.\\n\\n\\\"Given that mangroves everywhere in the world are made up of species in relatively few genera, we want to test certain particularities of each one. Rhizophora, for example, fructifies all year round, whereas propagules of Avicennia can be found only at certain times. Moreover, ocean currents vary from one year to another. These differences may help us understand how mangroves are formed and how each factor contributes to the process. We want to understand the roles of all these variables,\\\" Mori said.\\n\\nMore information: Andr\\u00e9 Guilherme Madeira et al, The role of oceanic currents in the dispersal and connectivity of the mangrove Rhizophora mangle on the Southwest Atlantic region, Molecular Ecology Resources (2023).

Trees assigned to cluster FC-K1 were primarily associated with the seaward fringe, whereas individuals assigned to FC-K2 were located more in the interior of the parcel. Limited genetic structure was observed across the four mangrove stands separated by 6\\u2013115 km in the Honduran Caribbean. However, subsequent analyses, with mangroves from Fort Cay grouped by their K-means clustering assignment, demonstrated that this pattern was caused primarily by the relationship among individuals situated along the seaward fringe and individuals at the other sites. Much greater genetic differentiation was observed between mangroves located in the interior of Fort Cay and the other sites. This suggests high levels of connectivity between mangroves along shorelines, which has been previously observed24, but that the hypothesis of low or limited genetic structure at fine-scales within R. mangle forests should be rejected. The significant genetic differentiation observed among individuals assigned to cluster FC-K2 on Fort Cay compared to all other sites, suggests at least two recruitment events from distinct sources have occurred within the Fort Cay parcel.\\n\\nFine-scale genetic structure\\n\\nOur analysis of a small parcel of mangrove forest revealed significant genetic structure at fine spatial scales, with two genetically distinct clusters of trees identified in STRUCTURE and assigned through K-means clustering. Our findings provide evidence that refute the hypothesis that (R. mangle) mangrove forests lack genetic structure13, with significant genetic differences occurring at 8\\u201310 m scales. We observed significant positive spatial autocorrelation at 2 m spatial scales, at 2\\u20138 m distance classes, and significant negative genetic spatial autocorrelation at 10\\u201318 m distance classes. These results indicate that individual clusters have a spatial dominance of 2\\u20138 m, and trees outside of this boundary are significantly different and potentially from different sources, either from distinct parental families within the same forest or from spatially distant sources.\\n\\nWe suggest that the genetic structure observed, both in genetic spatial autocorrelation and pairwise F ST analyses, could be the result of at least two different propagule sources which have recruited into this section of forest. The mangrove fringe, where wind and wave abatement primarily occurs, is the most dynamic area during storm events, and the part of the forest that suffers the most damage28 and provides protection to mangroves deeper within these systems. When the fringe is damaged by storms, there is the potential for recruitment of propagules from both local and distant sources, as storm waters are important drivers of mangrove dispersal and can facilitate long distance dispersal and range expansion of mangroves29. A total of 52 tropical storm and hurricane events have passed within 50 nautical miles of Fort Cay, from 1852 to 2016 (up to the time of sampling)30, the most severe was hurricane Mitch in 1998, which caused various levels of damage to mangrove stands throughout the Bay Islands, Honduras31. Such events could have had a role in shaping the genetic structure observed in the parcel of mangrove on Fort Cay. Damage to the fringe from tropical storms or hurricanes could have opened space for the recruitment of propagules from other populations that were dispersed by the storm event to the parcel. However, dispersal alone does not equate to recruitment success, as recruitment is influenced by numerous biotic and abiotic factors, including propagule predation rates32, sediment conditions33, and the presence of canopy gaps28,34. The sources and the mechanism of these different recruitment events is unknown, but with trees of various sizes associated with each of the identified clusters present, we suggest recruitment has persisted over various temporal and spatial scales. Whilst defining the drivers and spatial and temporal scales of dispersal and recruitment events are beyond the scope of this study, our results identify the influence of potential recruitment events, from either proximal or distal sources, on genetic diversity and structure at fine scales.\\n\\nLarge-scale genetic structure\\n\\nLimited genetic structure was observed in R. mangle forests between the four sampling sites within the Honduran Caribbean, at spatial scales of 6\\u2013115 km. These results suggest high levels of connectivity among mangroves within the Honduran Caribbean, and mirror findings from previous studies on both R. mangle and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) in the Mesoamerican Reef region and Gulf of Mexico, at scales of 100\\u2019s km35. A more recent study observed greater genetic structure between R. mangle stands located between these two ecoregions, but, limited genetic structure within an ecoregion, at spatial scales of 10\\u2019s to 100\\u2019s km19. By placing the two clusters identified in Fort Cay in a wider context of R. mangle forests from across the Honduran Caribbean, we suggest that the connectivity observed at large-scales in many studies is potentially an artifact of sampling design. Mangroves assigned to cluster FC-K1 were predominantly associated with the seaward fringe of the parcel, and were most genetically similar to the three other sampling sites, where samples had also been collected from the seaward fringe. In contrast, individuals assigned to cluster FC-K2 were associated with the greatest levels of genetic differentiation to R. mangle trees sampled from the seaward fringe, including FC-K1. The limited genetic structure at the larger scale may be explained by propagules being dispersed by prevailing currents and recruiting along the seaward fringe, as propagules are capable of dispersing 1000\\u2019s km1,36. Similarly, larval models have demonstrated high levels of connectivity for other marine species in the region37. Alternatively, individuals assigned to FC-K1 may represent local recruitment and individuals of FC-K2 represent recruitment from another unknown population. Due to the higher frequency of individuals assigned to cluster FC-K1, local recruitment may be dominant, but interspersed with recruitment events from other more distant populations, and that layers of these events build up as the forest matures. We can only hypothesize about the drivers of the genetic structure observed, however, we can state unequivocally that sampling only the seaward fringe of a mangrove stand does not provide a complete overview of genetic structure of mangroves at larger spatial scales, and may greatly influence our interpretation of genetic connectivity within these ecosystems.\\n\\nManagement and restoration implications\\n\\nGenetic structure has implications for ecosystem function and the composition of associated biodiversity17,38,39. Maintaining genetic diversity within mangroves (and other ecosystems) is of increasing importance during an era of unprecedented climate change, and therefore population genetics should be an essential component of management and restoration frameworks27,40,41. To improve management and conservation efforts it is essential to have a greater understanding of the genetic structure of mangroves at the forest and seascape scale, and to ensure that management occurs at the appropriate spatial scales. Previous population genetic studies have increased our understanding of dispersal mechanisms and connectivity of mangrove populations (see Van der Stocken et al.42), and sampling scales of 5\\u201330 m18,19,43,44, and up to 100 m45 have prevented sampling the same individual multiple times. However, most of these studies also only sampled along the seaward fringe of the mangrove. Our findings suggest that such sampling ranges are adequate, but based on the genetic structure observed here (i.e., positive spatial autocorrelation up to 8 m) we recommend sampling at similar spatial scales, 10\\u201330 m, into the interior of mangrove forests. Sampling inland, not just along, a coastline will provide greater representation of the genetic structure within a population. This in turn can inform the spatial scale required for effective management of mangroves across seascapes, and can be used to monitor the effectiveness of restoration projects in maintaining genetic diversity, which are fundamental to the success of forest management40,41, and restoration frameworks (see Mijangos et al.27). Maintaining genetic diversity and gene flow of restored forests is a critical step in building resistance, resilience and adaptation of restored mangroves to future environmental conditions46. Understanding the genetic structure of mangroves at the forest scale can also help inform propagule source selection and planting practices, where required. This study provides further evidence of how genetic and genomic tools can improve the monitoring and evaluation of the management and restoration of mangroves47,48.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Additionally, mangroves provide coastal protection, which can help reduce risks for coastal communities and properties. Furthermore, mangroves play a role in carbon sequestration, which can help stabilize greenhouse gas levels and limit the effects of climate change. Overall, assigning an economic value to mangroves can provide policymakers and administrators with additional reasons to push for the conservation of these valuable resources.'"
