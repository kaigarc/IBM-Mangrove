Over 30 years, the Saloum reserve of the biosphere's mangrove has lost approximately 40% of its area, amounting to about 750 km. Similarly, in Casamance, around 670 km of the ecosystem vanished during the same period. Despite these losses, recent studies indicate a potential recovery in certain areas, such as the Senegal-Gambia border of Saloum-Niumi and the Blis-Karone islands of Casamance. In these areas, women engaged in shellfish harvesting have observed changes in the mangrove forest, noting a decrease in density and a decline in the size and abundance of oysters and arches. The reasons behind the decline of mangroves in Senegal are multifaceted, including factors such as drought, the introduction of new techniques by both public and private actors, and the impact of the prolonged conflict in Casamance. During reforestation campaigns, women interviewed have voiced concerns about the degradation of mangroves and emphasized the importance of adopting sustainable management practices to address these issues.\n","\n","                  The query is as follows:\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"yI2W7yZ6RqMl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713506312499,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":138,"user":{"displayName":"Natasha Thussu Dhar","userId":"06843221064364226659"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query_input = 'tell me about important policies in Senegal for mangroves'\n","chain.run({'question': query_template + query_input})"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":198},"id":"ct-F400THZZm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713506327378,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":12118,"user":{"displayName":"Natasha Thussu Dhar","userId":"06843221064364226659"}},"outputId":"84b6bcaa-a5c4-4a75-8a61-a35613f506f9"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:117: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The function `run` was deprecated in LangChain 0.1.0 and will be removed in 0.2.0.

One significant program is the \"Plant your tree\" initiative, which is the largest mangrove reforestation program in the country. Launched in 2006 in the Casamance estuary and in 2008 in the Saloum Delta, this program is a partnership between a Senegalese NGO called Oceanium and various public and private entities, including the FFEM, Carbon Livelihoods Venture Fund, and companies like Danone and Yves Rocher. The goal of this initiative is to promote mangrove reforestation and restoration efforts to combat the decline of mangrove areas in Senegal.\\n\\nAdditionally, Senegal is part of the West Africa Marine and Coastal Conservation Platform (PRCM), which is a sub-regional partnership covering seven countries. This platform has led to the adoption of a Mangrove Charter and national action plans that promote inclusive and long-term governance of mangroves in Senegal and other member countries. The PRCM aims to coordinate conservation efforts and address the challenges faced by mangrove ecosystems in the region.\\n\\nFurthermore, there have been discussions and actions related to mangrove carbon policies in Senegal. These policies are part of broader efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable land use practices. However, there have been concerns raised about the potential risks of land grabbing and environmental injustice associated with these policies. Scholars have highlighted the need to consider social safeguards and the impacts of carbon policies on local communities, particularly women who rely on mangrove resources for their livelihoods.\\n\\nOverall, Senegal has been actively involved in implementing policies and programs to protect and restore mangrove ecosystems, recognizing their ecological, socio-cultural, and economic importance.
