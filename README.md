Dataset Description:
The dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/pruhtopia/mangrove-loss-dataset) is aimed at facilitating image segmentation models for mangrove loss detection. This dataset consists of a collection of annotated satellite images depicting mangrove areas. Each image is labeled to indicate regions of mangrove loss, allowing researchers and practitioners to train image segmentation models to automatically detect and analyze changes in mangrove coverage over time. With this dataset, users can develop and evaluate computer vision models for mangrove loss detection, contributing to environmental conservation efforts and research in coastal ecosystems.
