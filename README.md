# IBM-Mangrove

# Description
Mangrove forests are critical for mitigating the effect of climate change
on coastal areas by reducing the impact of storms and increasing
carbon sequestration. However, the total area of mangrove forests has
declined significantly. Given the advances in AI and the development of
a Geospatial foundation model by IBM, we developed a three-pronged
AI-driven approach to mangrove conservation: (1) satellite mangrove
segmentation models, (2) automated chatbot pipeline for scientific
Q&A, (3) analysis of mangrove loss.
