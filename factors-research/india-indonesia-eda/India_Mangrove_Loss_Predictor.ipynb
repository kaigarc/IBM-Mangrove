We prefer a higher absolute value, indicating a stronger relationship.\n","\n","- R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). We prefer a higher R², which suggests a greater explanatory power of the model.\n","\n","- Adjusted R-squared: Similar to R² but adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. A higher adjusted R² is preferred, especially when comparing models with a different number of independent variables.\n","\n","- F-statistic: Evaluates the overall significance of the model. A higher F-statistic is preferred as it suggests the model has greater explanatory power.\n","\n","- Prob (F-statistic): The p-value for the F-statistic. We prefer a smaller value, indicating that the model is statistically significant.\n","\n","- Coefficients: Represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable(s). Larger absolute values are generally preferred, but the sign should be consistent with the expected relationship.\n","\n","- P-value of Coefficients (P>|t|): Assesses the significance of individual regression coefficients. Smaller values are preferred as they suggest the variable is a significant predictor of the dependent variable.\n","\n","- Confidence Interval: Provides a range within which the true regression coefficient is likely to fall. We prefer narrower intervals, indicating more precision in the coefficient estimates.\n","\n","- Condition Number: Used to diagnose multicollinearity. Lower values are preferred as they suggest less multicollinearity.\n","\n","- Durbin-Watson Statistic: Tests for autocorrelation in the residuals. We prefer values close to 2, which indicate no autocorrelation.\n","\n","- Omnibus/Prob(Omnibus): Tests the combined skewness and kurtosis of the residuals. We prefer a higher p-value (p > 0.05) suggesting that the residuals are normally distributed.\n","\n","- Jarque-Bera (JB)/Prob(JB): Tests the normality of the residuals. We prefer a higher p-value indicating that the residuals are normally distributed, which is a desirable property in regression analysis.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ht-J4Xp0EfAe"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Make a copy of the prereg_df_imputed DataFrame to test the column removing process\n","reg_df_imputed = prereg_df_imputed.copy()\n","\n","# Remove the column 'GDP at current prices'\n","reg_df_imputed.drop('GDP at current prices', axis=1, inplace=True)\n","print(reg_df_imputed.shape)\n","reg_df_imputed.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ABax3UK3KCcK"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Calculate the correlation matrix\n","corr = reg_df_imputed.corr()\n","\n","# Create a mask to display only the lower triangle of the matrix\n","mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))\n","\n","# Create a pairplot\n","pairplot_fig = sns.pairplot(reg_df_imputed)\n","\n","# Loop through axes to plot the upper triangle with the correlation values\n","for i, j in zip(*np.triu_indices_from(pairplot_fig.axes, 1)):\n","    pairplot_fig.axes[i, j].set_visible(False)\n","    txt = f'{corr.iloc[i, j]:.2f}'\n","    pairplot_fig.axes[i, j].text(0.5, 0.5, txt, transform=pairplot_fig.axes[i, j].transAxes,\n","                                  ha='center', va='center', color='red', fontsize='large')\n","\n","plt.show()\n","\n","# Define a threshold for high correlation\n","threshold = 0.75  # For example, we choose 0.75 as the high correlation threshold\n","\n","# Find pairs with high correlation\n","high_corr_pairs = [(reg_df_imputed.columns[x], reg_df_imputed.columns[y], corr.iloc[x, y])\n","                   for x in range(len(corr.columns))\n","                   for y in range(x+1, len(corr.columns))\n","                   if abs(corr.iloc[x, y]) > threshold]\n","\n","# Print or store the high correlation pairs\n","for pair in high_corr_pairs:\n","    print(f\"{pair[0]} and {pair[1]} have a correlation of {pair[2]:.2f}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WUsp5WebEeTE"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WfOexDUza7uo"},"source":["### Collecting data on more variables"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"udl75yI2d8Qh"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["cic9Asq6PkXw","QliOTIOIVPN1","9yxVRjgIrvI2","TeQtvHnusE6m","63-kgFwMpktt","Gz8_STTjKUFm","9EqBs59ylYWx","DGZ2m4egVzmr"],"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.15"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
